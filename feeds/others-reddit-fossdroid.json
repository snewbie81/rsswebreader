It is an App for Android to take Notes or Tasks and we reached now over 400 downloads. I know there are many (fantastic) Apps like this outside but it always annoyed me that many of those Apps are from China or the US or not fully offline, ad-free or private e.g.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/dominikmuellr/trudido\">Trudido</a> is the opposite to that because I dont care about your data or anything.</p>\n\n<p>With Version 1.2.1 I enhanced the Markdown Editor in Notes with a WYSIWYG rich text editor. (Quill) And it got other new features like you can insert media like photos, videos, voicenotes eg.</p>\n\n<p>For the Notes it also has a function called &quot;Vault&quot; in which you can store sensitive notes and media encrypted on your device.</p>\n\n<p>And there is finally a new app icon! And it has the GPL-3.0 license.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you would like to try my App <a href=\"https://github.com/dominikmuellr/trudido\">Trudido</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks all for reading this and maybe see you in the comments!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/dominikmuellr/trudido\">https://github.com/dominikmuellr/trudido</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
