PACE was recommended as one of the most well-rounded options for tracking walks and hikes (anything fitness related), with solid stats and features.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, by the time I found it, development seemed to have stalled, and it&#39;s no longer available anywhere I can find. The <strong><em>website</em></strong> still has this &quot;update&quot; banner about a new version coming soon, but it&#39;s been up there for ages without any actual progress.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Their website: <a href=\"https://withpace.io/\">https://withpace.io/</a></li>\n<li>Github page: <a href=\"https://github.com/withpaceio/pace-app\">https://github.com/withpaceio/pace-app</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Just wondering if anyone here knows more about it or if the app is officially dead. Any info would be appreciated!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
