I was a hater first because with my limited understanding I felt its being overhyped, so I looked into it, installed and trained some local models, spent some time learning about how they are trained, what is the transformers architecture etc. I have arrived to a point where I have my opinion but I notice massive parties on both sides.</p>\n\n<p>So if you consider yourself neither pro or contra AI, but rather somewhere in between, please tell me what you think about this tech, how you think it can be used, what effects its gonna have, are you using it, etc</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve spent the last few weeks converting a shelf of DVDs to MKVs for a living-room player and a travel SSD. It&#39;s a mix of movies and TV box sets; some discs are perfectly normal, others… not so much. I&#39;m trying to end up with uniform, chapter-accurate MKVs, and (only when it&#39;s worth it) a clean H.264/H.265 transcode to save space.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m after a one-stop workflow because jumping between tools keeps creating tiny failure points and inconsistent results. I&#39;ve had episodes lose chapters, or the codec/container change because I had to rescue a few by hand. Rip here, fix subs/chapters elsewhere, then remux again - works for a handful of discs…but not for hundreds.</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s your best tool to convert DVDs to MKVs and encoding to H.264/H.265? If you have a setup that stays stable across lots of discs, I&#39;d love the exact steps and settings (chapters/forced-sub handling, bitrate/CRF for SD, etc).</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m sorry if this is a bit of a rant, but I really have to say this somewhere, and I think it also applies to much more than just this specific program. I had deleted a bunch of photos that hold great importance to me on a flash drive at a time when I had much less regard for their importance. I had the idea to use data recovery software, since I didn&#39;t believe I overwrote the data at any point. Nothing I had tried was working until I found Disk Drill, and after scanning for something like 15 minutes, I was finally able to see photos I hadn&#39;t seen in years. I was nearly to the point of tears. After looking through them on the program and selecting the ones I wanted to recover, I clicked the button to recover and was hit by this pop-up that said that I couldn&#39;t recover the images that I literally saw right on my screen unless I upgraded to the pro plan, which I can&#39;t afford. They could&#39;ve put the paywall at download or at least made it clear you couldn&#39;t do much of anything unless you got the pro plan, but instead they decided to dangle the recovered files in my face before telling me I couldn&#39;t have them unless I paid. At this point, it&#39;s basically glorified ransomware for files I accidentally deleted. It&#39;s one thing to have a paid file recovery program, but a whole other thing for one to act free (their website calls it a free app) and then make you pay when it&#39;s already loaded the files that you need to recover (it showed the thumbnails of the deleted files). Worst part is that Disk Drill isn&#39;t the only program doing this, this seems to be a trend.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
