I&#39;m trying to end up with uniform, chapter-accurate MKVs, and (only when it&#39;s worth it) a clean H.264/H.265 transcode to save space.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m after a one-stop workflow because jumping between tools keeps creating tiny failure points and inconsistent results. I&#39;ve had episodes lose chapters, or the codec/container change because I had to rescue a few by hand. Rip here, fix subs/chapters elsewhere, then remux again - works for a handful of discs…but not for hundreds.</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s your best tool to convert DVDs to MKVs and encoding to H.264/H.265? If you have a setup that stays stable across lots of discs, I&#39;d love the exact steps and settings (chapters/forced-sub handling, bitrate/CRF for SD, etc).</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m sorry if this is a bit of a rant, but I really have to say this somewhere, and I think it also applies to much more than just this specific program. I had deleted a bunch of photos that hold great importance to me on a flash drive at a time when I had much less regard for their importance. I had the idea to use data recovery software, since I didn&#39;t believe I overwrote the data at any point. Nothing I had tried was working until I found Disk Drill, and after scanning for something like 15 minutes, I was finally able to see photos I hadn&#39;t seen in years. I was nearly to the point of tears. After looking through them on the program and selecting the ones I wanted to recover, I clicked the button to recover and was hit by this pop-up that said that I couldn&#39;t recover the images that I literally saw right on my screen unless I upgraded to the pro plan, which I can&#39;t afford. They could&#39;ve put the paywall at download or at least made it clear you couldn&#39;t do much of anything unless you got the pro plan, but instead they decided to dangle the recovered files in my face before telling me I couldn&#39;t have them unless I paid. At this point, it&#39;s basically glorified ransomware for files I accidentally deleted. It&#39;s one thing to have a paid file recovery program, but a whole other thing for one to act free (their website calls it a free app) and then make you pay when it&#39;s already loaded the files that you need to recover (it showed the thumbnails of the deleted files). Worst part is that Disk Drill isn&#39;t the only program doing this, this seems to be a trend.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

You press a hotkey (<code>Win+Shift+A</code>), draw a box around any text on your screen, and it uses Google&#39;s Gemini AI to OCR and translate it instantly in a floating overlay.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Universal:</strong> Works on anything visible on your screen (browsers, PDFs, UI elements).</li>\n<li><strong>Game Mode:</strong> Has a specific toggle to force it to work over exclusive full-screen games.</li>\n<li><strong>AI Powered:</strong> Since it uses Gemini, the translations are context-aware and much better than standard literal translations.</li>\n<li><strong>Portable:</strong> It’s a single <code>.exe</code>  with no installation required.</li>\n<li><strong>Open Source:</strong> Written in Python.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Cost:</strong> The app itself is completely free and open-source. It requires your own Google Gemini API key (which is currently free for personal use).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Links:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GitHub &amp; Download:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/Misaghlb/Transnap/releases/latest\">https://github.com/Misaghlb/Transnap/releases/latest</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
