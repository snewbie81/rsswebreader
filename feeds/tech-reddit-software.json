It&#39;s entirely web-based.</p>\n\n<p>For those who don&#39;t know what RSS is (I knew what it was for years but never actually used it until I got interested in this project, and now I use it every day for my news consumption), RSS allows you to collect information, articles, or podcasts from various websites all in one place - a reader.</p>\n\n<p>The existing RSS readers I found felt overwhelming with too many options and complex settings. I just wanted something simple that works straight away, without needing a manual to set up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What makes my app different?</strong><br/>\nIt is, I hope, much simpler to use. It includes full podcast support, including a queue and an audio player. But it also has a unique feature that I haven&#39;t seen elsewhere. It&#39;s my own invention.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does the &quot;ReWind&quot; feature work?</strong><br/>\nIt sends you notifications about old content - for example, older YouTube videos, or older RSS items.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s say you discover a new YouTube channel. You like it, or maybe you want to re-watch videos from your favorite creator. But they have over 100 videos. You don&#39;t have time to watch them all right now, and realistically, you never will. My app answers this problem.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You simply choose:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Where to start:</strong> From the very beginning (the first video), or maybe just the last 50.</li>\n<li><strong>The interval:</strong> Every 1 to 7 days.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Then, every day (or every week, depending on your setting), you will receive these &quot;old&quot; videos in your <a href=\"http://rewindbypaul.com/userfeed\"><strong>ReWindByPaul.com/userfeed</strong></a> panel, as if they were new.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you find a history channel with hundreds of documentaries, you get the first one immediately, and then one video a day for the next 250 days. (Note: I limit YouTube archives to 250 items due to technical reasons).</p>\n\n<p><strong>If that sounds good, you can test these examples:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>60 Minutes</strong> (Famous news magazine): <a href=\"https://rewindbypaul.com/channel/yt/?link=68dab97a030e94470c1916cf\">Link</a></li>\n<li><strong>Macroblank</strong> (Cool music): <a href=\"https://rewindbypaul.com/channel/yt/?link=68d58251633c9c558fabd34e\">Link</a></li>\n<li><strong>The Jordan Harbinger Show</strong> (General interest podcast): <a href=\"https://rewindbypaul.com/channel/podcast/?link=691a5297f4549433ef5049d3\">Link</a></li>\n<li><strong>Noah Smith</strong> (Popular economic blogger): <a href=\"https://rewindbypaul.com/channel/rss/?link=691667e863caeed9af930803\">Link</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Or you can add your favorite stuff.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Regarding features:</strong><br/>\nI aimed for simplicity for regular users. It doesn&#39;t have AI summarization or complex nested folders right now - just a clean feed of the content you want, though you can filter it by RSS, Podcast, or YouTube.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>If this sounds interesting, please create an account and test it out:</strong><br/>\n<a href=\"https://rewindbypaul.com\">https://ReWindByPaul.com</a></p>\n\n<p>If you like it, you can support the project at <strong>ReWindByPaul.com/premium</strong>. Supporters get higher limits and no ads.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roadmap:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Android App:</strong> Currently on the way. You can sign up for early access on the main page.</li>\n<li><strong>iOS App:</strong> In the future plans (you can express interest on the main page).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Feedback:</strong><br/>\nIn case of problems, suggestions, or questions about pricing/limits, you can send your feedback via <a href=\"http://rewindbypaul.com/reportproblem\"><strong>ReWindByPaul.com/reportproblem</strong></a>, email me at [<a href=\"mailto:rewindbypaul@gmail.com\">rewindbypaul@gmail.com</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:rewindbypaul@gmail.com\">rewindbypaul@gmail.com</a>), or at [<a href=\"mailto:contact@rewindbypaul.com\">contact@rewindbypaul.com</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:contact@rewindbypaul.com\">contact@rewindbypaul.com</a>).</p>\n\n<p>For the power users among you: if you like the ReWind feature, you can also create your own public curated collections of links that others can &quot;ReWind&quot; through.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for checking it out!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I started with a tiny Python OCR script, but the project kept growing… and now it turned into a full Windows app built with WinUI 3.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s what MySorty can do:</p>\n\n<p>🔍 OCR &amp; Automation: \nOCR for PDFs and images → creates searchable PDFs .\n• Automatic language detection.\n• Watches an Input Folder and processes new files instantly.</p>\n\n<p>🗂️ Smart Sorting:\n• Create tag rules with keywords &amp; priorities.\n• Automatically sorts PDFs into subfolders based on matching keywords.\n• Automatically archives the original PDFs in the same folder structure as the OCRed PDFs.</p>\n\n<p>📧 Email Integration:\n• Fetch PDFs from IMAP or Microsoft OAuth2 mail accounts.\n• Add “allowed senders” so only trusted PDFs are downloaded.\n• Everything is then OCRed, sorted, and archived automatically.</p>\n\n<p>📄 Merge &amp; Organize:\n• Automatic PDF merging (I built this because my scanner isn’t duplex).\n• Watches a Merge Folder and combines all PDFs into one document.\n• Merged PDFs are also OCRed, sorted, and archived.</p>\n\n<p>👀 Built-in PDF Viewer:\n• Preview PDFs directly inside the app.\n• Rotate pages and save changes.\n• No need for external PDF software</p>\n\n<p>And the best part everything is done locally so no Cloud Uploads!</p>\n\n<p>Basically, every feature in MySorty exists because I needed it myself, and now it’s become a tool that handles my entire document workflow.</p>\n\n<p>If you’d like to check it out: 👉 <a href=\"http://www.tkbitsupport.de\">www.tkbitsupport.de</a></p>\n\n<p>Happy to hear any thoughts or feedback! 😁</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
