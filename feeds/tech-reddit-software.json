I was using Google drive all the time but the search bar always failed to get the right document out if i forgot the exact title.</p>\n\n<p>I built this tool based on my research that can very effectively tag a huge amount of text files (even the very long files) comprehensively and automatically organize all the files into a clearn structure. I also designed a tag-based searching algorithm that helps me easily find the files by their semantic meanings (even when your search query is very vague). This is very easy to use and a few friends are testing on it but i still don&#39;t know if this tool is useful for more people.</p>\n\n<p>I found that after i add some simple editor and more sophisticated searching functionalities, this tool in fact became a very nice personal knowledge base like i can store all the papers and articles i want to read to it and it can properly organize them. </p>\n\n<p>So I hope to get some people to test this tool and just give some feedback. I just released this tool on this website:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.unidrive.ai\">www.unidrive.ai</a></p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading — even a single comment helps.</p>\n\n<p>Below is a screenshot of how that tool looks like.
