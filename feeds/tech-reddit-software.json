It’s designed to help reduce eye strain during long screen sessions by reminding you to follow the 20–20–20 rule:</p>\n\n<p>Every 20 minutes, look at something about 20 feet (~6 meters) away for at least 20 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>I spend a lot of time in front of a monitor (coding, studying, etc.) and kept forgetting to take short eye breaks, so I ended up building a tiny tool that quietly takes care of the timing for me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What EyeRest does</strong></p>\n\n<p>- Runs quietly in the system tray (notification area).</p>\n\n<p>- Shows a desktop notification when it’s time to rest your eyes:</p>\n\n<p>- Uses Windows 10/11 toast notifications when available,</p>\n\n<p>- Falls back to a classic tray balloon if toasts aren’t supported or fail.</p>\n\n<p>- Lets you configure the reminder interval (default is 20 minutes).</p>\n\n<p>- Optional left-click toggle on the tray icon:</p>\n\n<p>- One icon when reminders are active,</p>\n\n<p>- A “snoozed” icon when reminders are off.</p>\n\n<p>- Small Options dialog + an About window (version, author, privacy note).</p>\n\n<p>- Built with .NET Framework 4.8 / WinForms, using an ApplicationContext so it runs without a main window.</p>\n\n<p>The goal is to keep it as minimal and unobtrusive as possible: no big UI, no background services, just a tray icon and a couple of small dialogs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Privacy</strong></p>\n\n<p>- No telemetry  </p>\n\n<p>- No accounts  </p>\n\n<p>- No network calls  </p>\n\n<p>Everything happens locally on your machine. The app only shows notifications, updates the tray icon, and opens small windows. The source code is available if you’d like to verify this or adapt it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Download / Source</strong></p>\n\n<p>- Microsoft Store (MSIX desktop app)  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9MW31PJW185Q\">https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9MW31PJW185Q</a></p>\n\n<p>- GitHub (source code + MSI and MSIX installer)  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/necdetsanli/EyeRest\">https://github.com/necdetsanli/EyeRest</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Feedback / contributions</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you try <strong>EyeRest</strong> and have ideas for extra options (e.g. better persistence, snooze behavior, smarter idle detection) or run into any issues, I’d really appreciate your feedback.</p>\n\n<p>You can reply here or open an issue/PR on GitHub – I’m open to suggestions and contributions.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading, and remember to give your eyes a break 🙂</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
