Well…</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instead of support, I got:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>contradictory emails from their own staff</li>\n<li>claims that I “forgot” product components I never had in the first place</li>\n<li>aggressive replies whenever I asked them to fix their own billing/upgrade mistake</li>\n<li>and eventually… their <em>general counsel</em> telling me they “don’t have inexhaustible patience for my antics.” (Yes, really. For asking about an order I paid for.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To make things worse, their colleague claimed he sent me an email on a date that simply never happened – even though I attached all the message history proving it. When I pointed this out, they doubled down instead of correcting their mistake.</p>\n\n<p>And the best part? After providing them with all receipts, dates, and proof, I’m told the order is “too old” to refund and that I violated their ToS (no explanation, no details, nothing).</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong><br/>\nPaid for a product.

I&#39;m a veterinary PhD student, and I&#39;d like to ask for some tips on softwares that might help me measure the dilation of a cow&#39;s pupils. I&#39;m recording the moment of dilation in 4k quality with 60 frames per second, and my idea is to measure the distance between the borders of the pupils in different frames in order to stipulate dilation speed and intensity. I tried to illustrate my idea in the photo.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/preview/pre/i3sypggwfb3g1.jpg?width=1181&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e781298a56e922c5bf4843ee15e238351d2ead52\">/preview/pre/i3sypggwfb3g1.jpg?width=1181&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e781298a56e922c5bf4843ee15e238351d2ead52</a></p>\n\n<p>Since the cows move a lot. using a scale in the video is a little difficult, so I plan on using the proportion between those two lines for the analysis. If someone could recommend me a software that enables me to move the video frame by frame (like a slideshow, perhaps?) and draw lines with measurements, either in the video or in images extracted from the video, that would be much appreciated. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
