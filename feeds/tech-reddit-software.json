        "content": "<p>Hello everyone, I'm a software engineer working in the past two years in the e-commerce adtech field (6 months of Internship &amp; 1.5 years of full time). I joined an early stage startup. Learned a lot about building Amazon advertising systems, built Walmart's advertising system on my own. Been an on-call engineer for so much time (in a weekly rotation). There are good days and there are bad days. It's a WFH job. But it doesn't pay what I feel like it should pay.</p>\n\n<p>Now I'm getting a new role at another early stage startup. The work will be basically the same but the pay is significantly higher in a WFO job. High enough that even in a WFO job it's good enough. But what I've learned from the interview rounds is that this company has a culture of overtime work and weekend work as well. This would be one con, another would be that I'd be building a system similar to one that I've already built but in a completely different tech stack. Modern tech stack if I may. It may start to feel like repetitive work.\nI'd also be working in a team for one product where as at my current organisation it's more like one product/feature per person (which is a good improvement).\nAlso they have 6 months appraisal cycle and they give decent appraisals.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know it feels like I'm convincing myself. Should I take this offer or prepare for a better offer at a bigger company like Phonepe etc.?</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Working at low pay in a WFH job at an early stage startup. Work is pretty easy for me now and hours are pretty chill.</p>\n\n<p>Got a similar job at a higher pay in the same industry at another early stage startup in WFO mode. High work hours (sometimes including weekends as well)\n6 months appraisal cycle. Modern tech stack and different tech stack as well which will expand my knowledge base as well. Defined roles as opposed to one guy doing everything at current company.</p>\n\n<p>Should I switch or should I work for a better offer?</p>\n",
