I had deleted a bunch of photos that hold great importance to me on a flash drive at a time when I had much less regard for their importance. I had the idea to use data recovery software, since I didn&#39;t believe I overwrote the data at any point. Nothing I had tried was working until I found Disk Drill, and after scanning for something like 15 minutes, I was finally able to see photos I hadn&#39;t seen in years. I was nearly to the point of tears. After looking through them on the program and selecting the ones I wanted to recover, I clicked the button to recover and was hit by this pop-up that said that I couldn&#39;t recover the images that I literally saw right on my screen unless I upgraded to the pro plan, which I can&#39;t afford. They could&#39;ve put the paywall at download or at least made it clear you couldn&#39;t do much of anything unless you got the pro plan, but instead they decided to dangle the recovered files in my face before telling me I couldn&#39;t have them unless I paid. At this point, it&#39;s basically glorified ransomware for files I accidentally deleted. It&#39;s one thing to have a paid file recovery program, but a whole other thing for one to act free (their website calls it a free app) and then make you pay when it&#39;s already loaded the files that you need to recover (it showed the thumbnails of the deleted files). Worst part is that Disk Drill isn&#39;t the only program doing this, this seems to be a trend.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Fiquei \nsabendo que existe uma máquina que lê pensamentos sem fio algum conectado a você. Lê seus pensamentos e faz a reconstrução de imagens que sua mente cria, com isso você testa a pessoa com associação de objetos, símbolos, palavras, cheiro para fazer a pessoa viver uma lembrança dela (Memória) (coisas pessoais) com isso você consegue descobrir a vida da pessoa toda. Tudo mesmo até de coisas que vc tinha quando criança, coisas que viu e n lembra, você consegue acessar todo o cérebro da pessoa e pode roubar os dados dela ainda. Tem no Brasil se n me engano</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I work in IT, and something&#39;s been bothering me for a while now. I was helping a friend set up his new PC last weekend, and he casually mentioned he just dropped $60 on a Windows key from the Microsoft Store. Then he goes to Adobe&#39;s website and drops like $55 on a subscription Then another $40 on some productivity software. Then we started talking about the games he wanted to buy, and I realized... most people have absolutely no idea they&#39;re being massively overcharged for software.</p>\n\n<p>My friend is a smart guy. He&#39;s not careless with money. But he&#39;s been conditioned to believe that whatever price Steam or Adobe or Microsoft shows him is just &quot;the price.&quot; Like there&#39;s no alternative. No other option. You want the software? You pay what they tell you to pay. I tried explaining to him that you can get the same exact keys and licenses for way less if you just... look around. He didn&#39;t believe me at first. Thought I was talking about some shady grey-market stuff.</p>\n\n<p>Then I told him he can find same software/games across different authorized stores. The games he just bought for $70 each on Steam? Listed for $28-35 from legitimate retailers. Same exact keys. Same exact licenses. Just different stores with better regional pricing or bulk deals.</p>\n\n<p>The reality nobody talks about:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Game keys: Steam/Epic prices vs authorized key sellers can differ by 40-70%</li>\n<li>Software licenses: Windows, Adobe, Office-all available way cheaper from legit resellers</li>\n<li>Subscriptions: Regional pricing differences are absolutely wild</li>\n<li>Everything else: If it&#39;s software, there&#39;s probably a better deal somewhere</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And this isn&#39;t sketchy stuff. These are authorized sellers. Legal keys. Everything above board. It&#39;s just that most people don&#39;t even know to look because we&#39;ve been trained to think there&#39;s only one &quot;official&quot; price. So... How many of you actually compare software prices before buying? Or do most of us just go straight to Steam/Adobe/Microsoft and pay whatever they ask because it&#39;s &quot;easier&quot;?</p>\n\n<p>I feel like this should be common knowledge, but apparently it&#39;s not. What am I missing here?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
