So far I have been quite unsuccessful.</p>\n\n<p>Two Options I have tried are: IPEXO IPTV Player and Neutro IPTV Player.</p>\n\n<p>They work alright and load the EPG layout. But the program information doesn&#39;t load. Not in my experience anyways, I&#39;ve open and closed the apps, left them open for an hour, but no program info is loading. But with Tivimate on my Google TV, it loaded all the EPG information for channels in about 10 minutes. These are all free version&#39;s I&#39;m using, including Tivimate.</p>\n\n<p>An application that I do like for Windows is: Open TV</p>\n\n<p>Open TV is completely free and the software works really fast and you can search on the fly fast as well. It&#39;s also got a buffer you can set. Shows all the nerdy stats if you want to see it. But it has no EPG as far as I can tell.</p>\n\n<p>Also. I tried the route of emulating Tivimate on my PC with Bluestacks and LDplayer. Apparently Tivimate isn&#39;t supported on Tablets and Phones, which Bluestacks and LDplayer mimics as.

You need to know Python, understand APIs, and wrestle with complex libraries just to make something simple.</p>\n\n<p>So, I started building Blokks.</p>\n\n<p>What is Blokks?</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a visual programming platform where you build AI workflows by connecting blocks—think Scratch or Node-RED, but specifically designed for modern AI models (GPT, Claude, Stable Diffusion, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>· Drag and Drop: Pull blocks for inputs, AI models, logic, and outputs onto a canvas. · Connect Them: Draw lines to define how data flows. · Run It: Execute the workflow and see the results instantly.</p>\n\n<p>The Goal: To make AI creation accessible to everyone—students, artists, entrepreneurs, and hobbyists—without requiring a computer science degree.</p>\n\n<p>A simple example workflow: [Text Input]-&gt; [GPT-4 Block] -&gt; [Text-to-Speech Block] -&gt; [Play Audio] Result:You type a sentence, and it&#39;s read back to you by an AI voice.</p>\n\n<p>You could build things like custom chatbots, image generators with specific styles, data analyzers, or content summarizers, all without writing a single line of code.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not here to launch yet, but to get feedback. The core visual interface is working, and I&#39;m opening up a pre-order for the first 500 founding members before a public launch later this year.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d love to know:</p>\n\n<p>Does this concept resonate with you? Is a visual interface something you&#39;d use?</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s the first AI-powered tool or workflow you would try to build?</p>\n\n<p>For the developers here: What are the biggest pitfalls you foresee in a project like this?</p>\n\n<p>This is a passion project, and all feedback—the good, the bad, and the brutal—is incredibly valuable.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re interested in following the journey, you can check out a visual mockup and learn more on the Blokks Landing Page.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading!

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi! I’m not totally sure if this is the right forum for this, but I recently acquired a BD burner (Model No. CB31005) and have burned a few of my favorite hard-to-find films to Blu-ray discs ONLY for my personal use. I use Shutter Encoder to hardcode subtitles and convert .mkv to .mp4 in order to use Toast 17 Titanium w/ the Blu-Ray extension to burn the discs. There are no issues converting, but once the discs are burned, there is severe frame rate choppiness and un-synced audio. This problem doesn’t arise until playback (I use a PS5 to play my discs and typically have no issues with playback, including DVDs I’ve burned with DVDStyler, only the Blu-rays). If anyone can help me figure this out, I would be eternally grateful!</p>\n\n<p>Some additional information: I am working with a 2019 MacBook Pro (i7 chip, Tahoe 26.0.1) so unfortunately my options are limited when it comes to Blu-ray authoring software, as most seem to only work with Windows. Another issue I have with Toast is that it will crash whenever I select the “Edit” button for the files, so I don’t know if there are settings within that that’re causing the issues (a solution for this would also be great). Ideally I would upgrade to the newest version of Toast but they charge absurd amounts for updates. I use DVDStyler to burn DVDs with no problems but they don’t offer Blu-ray support. I can also provide more specific information in the comments if needed/requested! Thank you in advance! &lt;3</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
