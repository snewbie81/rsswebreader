The big issue I’ve come across is programs for auto generating forms for signature and custom receipts. They seem very expensive atleast the two I’ve tried pandadoc and signnow after using the monthly or yearly credit for automation it comes out to about $4 on pandadoc and $3 on signow per customer. If that’s not expensive please just let me know I’m being cheap</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions on other programs for document generation?
