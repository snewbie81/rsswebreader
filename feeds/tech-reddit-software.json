The order was confirmed, paid, and processed through PayPro Global. Sounds simple, right? Well…</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instead of support, I got:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>contradictory emails from their own staff</li>\n<li>claims that I “forgot” product components I never had in the first place</li>\n<li>aggressive replies whenever I asked them to fix their own billing/upgrade mistake</li>\n<li>and eventually… their <em>general counsel</em> telling me they “don’t have inexhaustible patience for my antics.” (Yes, really. For asking about an order I paid for.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To make things worse, their colleague claimed he sent me an email on a date that simply never happened – even though I attached all the message history proving it. When I pointed this out, they doubled down instead of correcting their mistake.</p>\n\n<p>And the best part? After providing them with all receipts, dates, and proof, I’m told the order is “too old” to refund and that I violated their ToS (no explanation, no details, nothing).</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong><br/>\nPaid for a product. Got contradictory statements, false claims, attitude, and finally a refusal to help. InstallAware’s customer service is easily the most unprofessional behavior I’ve seen from a software vendor.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re considering purchasing from InstallAware:<br/>\n<strong>think twice.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I have ImgBurn, but I can&#39;t find an option that allows you to keep writing to the disc. It just seems to write the files and that&#39;s it - you have to erase the entire thing and do it all over from scratch. If anyone&#39;s aware of what option I need to toggle for it to work, that would be awesome. Otherwise, what are some other good examples I could try?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
