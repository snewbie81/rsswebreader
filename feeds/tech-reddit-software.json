Today I’m launching the beta and would love to get feedback from experienced developers here.</p>\n\n<p>The main idea is that all encryption happens on the client side, so the server never sees plaintext passwords. The backend stores only encrypted data, handles user authentication, and enforces premium access securely.</p>\n\n<p>This project has helped me learn a lot about cryptography, secure key handling, backend design, and web security. It’s not a commercial product yet  just something I’m building to improve my skills.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a chance, I’d appreciate your thoughts on:</p>\n\n<p>Code structure and maintainability</p>\n\n<p>Security design and potential weak points</p>\n\n<p>User experience and UI flow</p>\n\n<p>Anything else you notice or think could be improved</p>\n\n<p>Since it’s still in beta, I don’t recommend storing your most important passwords here yet.</p>\n\n<p>You can check the code out here: <a href=\"https://github.com/devbytho/eazypasswords\">https://github.com/devbytho/eazypasswords</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Don&#39;t we have something that still does all those things, but out of the box or with minimum setup? I guess it can&#39;t work within terminal (or within some specific terminal that supports images and that stuff), so GUI options are also ok if Vim-like workflow integrated well.
