      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I built a content aggregator called <a href=\"http://rewindbypaul.com\"><strong>ReWindByPaul.com</strong></a>. It handles RSS, Podcasts, and YouTube, but it has a specific feature called &quot;ReWind&quot; that handles content that has already been added in the past. It&#39;s entirely web-based.</p>\n\n<p>For those who don&#39;t know what RSS is (I knew what it was for years but never actually used it until I got interested in this project, and now I use it every day for my news consumption), RSS allows you to collect information, articles, or podcasts from various websites all in one place - a reader.</p>\n\n<p>The existing RSS readers I found felt overwhelming with too many options and complex settings. I just wanted something simple that works straight away, without needing a manual to set up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What makes my app different?</strong><br/>\nIt is, I hope, much simpler to use. It includes full podcast support, including a queue and an audio player. But it also has a unique feature that I haven&#39;t seen elsewhere. It&#39;s my own invention.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does the &quot;ReWind&quot; feature work?</strong><br/>\nIt sends you notifications about old content - for example, older YouTube videos, or older RSS items.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s say you discover a new YouTube channel. You like it, or maybe you want to re-watch videos from your favorite creator. But they have over 100 videos. You don&#39;t have time to watch them all right now, and realistically, you never will. My app answers this problem.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You simply choose:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Where to start:</strong> From the very beginning (the first video), or maybe just the last 50.</li>\n<li><strong>The interval:</strong> Every 1 to 7 days.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Then, every day (or every week, depending on your setting), you will receive these &quot;old&quot; videos in your <a href=\"http://rewindbypaul.com/userfeed\"><strong>ReWindByPaul.com/userfeed</strong></a> panel, as if they were new.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you find a history channel with hundreds of documentaries, you get the first one immediately, and then one video a day for the next 250 days. (Note: I limit YouTube archives to 250 items due to technical reasons).</p>\n\n<p><strong>If that sounds good, you can test these examples:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>60 Minutes</strong> (Famous news magazine): <a href=\"https://rewindbypaul.com/channel/yt/?link=68dab97a030e94470c1916cf\">Link</a></li>\n<li><strong>Macroblank</strong> (Cool music): <a href=\"https://rewindbypaul.com/channel/yt/?link=68d58251633c9c558fabd34e\">Link</a></li>\n<li><strong>The Jordan Harbinger Show</strong> (General interest podcast): <a href=\"https://rewindbypaul.com/channel/podcast/?link=691a5297f4549433ef5049d3\">Link</a></li>\n<li><strong>Noah Smith</strong> (Popular economic blogger): <a href=\"https://rewindbypaul.com/channel/rss/?link=691667e863caeed9af930803\">Link</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Or you can add your favorite stuff.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Regarding features:</strong><br/>\nI aimed for simplicity for regular users. It doesn&#39;t have AI summarization or complex nested folders right now - just a clean feed of the content you want, though you can filter it by RSS, Podcast, or YouTube.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>If this sounds interesting, please create an account and test it out:</strong><br/>\n<a href=\"https://rewindbypaul.com\">https://ReWindByPaul.com</a></p>\n\n<p>If you like it, you can support the project at <strong>ReWindByPaul.com/premium</strong>. Supporters get higher limits and no ads.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roadmap:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Android App:</strong> Currently on the way. You can sign up for early access on the main page.</li>\n<li><strong>iOS App:</strong> In the future plans (you can express interest on the main page).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Feedback:</strong><br/>\nIn case of problems, suggestions, or questions about pricing/limits, you can send your feedback via <a href=\"http://rewindbypaul.com/reportproblem\"><strong>ReWindByPaul.com/reportproblem</strong></a>, email me at [<a href=\"mailto:rewindbypaul@gmail.com\">rewindbypaul@gmail.com</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:rewindbypaul@gmail.com\">rewindbypaul@gmail.com</a>), or at [<a href=\"mailto:contact@rewindbypaul.com\">contact@rewindbypaul.com</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:contact@rewindbypaul.com\">contact@rewindbypaul.com</a>).</p>\n\n<p>For the power users among you: if you like the ReWind feature, you can also create your own public curated collections of links that others can &quot;ReWind&quot; through.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for checking it out!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s a very old version of Unreal Engine (I think unreal tournament was made on it) I downloaded <a href=\"https://www.moddb.com/engines/unreal-development-kit/downloads/february-2015-unreal-development-kit-udk\">this</a> software for college, (It&#39;s worth noting I downloaded a different version (UDKInstall-2015-01) from my college, as I was told I had to use the colleges specific version). Which I did, but I can only open the playable version, and not the actual editor itself, I was told by my lecturer last week to make a shortcut to a file I can&#39;t remember, and change the shortcut target from &quot;bla\\bla\\bla\\UDK.exe&quot; to &quot;bla\\bla\\bla\\UDKEditor.exe&quot;. Someone online also said change the filepath to &quot;UDK.exe editor&quot;. Didn&#39;t help.</p>\n\n<p>Tried this for multiple different files to no avail as it just says the file path does not exist. ChatGPT can&#39;t help, and the very little bit of advice I could find online from 10 years ago is just &quot;Open the UDK Editor file&quot; (Gee thanks (I don&#39;t have this file btw, I THOROUGHLY checked)). I know that a maximum of 3 people have even heard of this software before, nevermind used it, but would anyone know how to access the editor?</p>\n\n<p>(Also might be useful I am using the Win64 version, but the files are identical to the Win32 version). Any help would be massively appreciated</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

The order was confirmed, paid, and processed through PayPro Global. Sounds simple, right? Well…</p>\n\n<p><strong>Instead of support, I got:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>contradictory emails from their own staff</li>\n<li>claims that I “forgot” product components I never had in the first place</li>\n<li>aggressive replies whenever I asked them to fix their own billing/upgrade mistake</li>\n<li>and eventually… their <em>general counsel</em> telling me they “don’t have inexhaustible patience for my antics.” (Yes, really. For asking about an order I paid for.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To make things worse, their colleague claimed he sent me an email on a date that simply never happened – even though I attached all the message history proving it. When I pointed this out, they doubled down instead of correcting their mistake.</p>\n\n<p>And the best part? After providing them with all receipts, dates, and proof, I’m told the order is “too old” to refund and that I violated their ToS (no explanation, no details, nothing).</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong><br/>\nPaid for a product. Got contradictory statements, false claims, attitude, and finally a refusal to help. InstallAware’s customer service is easily the most unprofessional behavior I’ve seen from a software vendor.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re considering purchasing from InstallAware:<br/>\n<strong>think twice.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
