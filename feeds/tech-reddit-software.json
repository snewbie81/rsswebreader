It&#39;s a mix of movies and TV box sets; some discs are perfectly normal, others… not so much. I&#39;m trying to end up with uniform, chapter-accurate MKVs, and (only when it&#39;s worth it) a clean H.264/H.265 transcode to save space.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m after a one-stop workflow because jumping between tools keeps creating tiny failure points and inconsistent results. I&#39;ve had episodes lose chapters, or the codec/container change because I had to rescue a few by hand. Rip here, fix subs/chapters elsewhere, then remux again - works for a handful of discs…but not for hundreds.</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s your best tool to convert DVDs to MKVs and encoding to H.264/H.265? If you have a setup that stays stable across lots of discs, I&#39;d love the exact steps and settings (chapters/forced-sub handling, bitrate/CRF for SD, etc).</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m sorry if this is a bit of a rant, but I really have to say this somewhere, and I think it also applies to much more than just this specific program. I had deleted a bunch of photos that hold great importance to me on a flash drive at a time when I had much less regard for their importance. I had the idea to use data recovery software, since I didn&#39;t believe I overwrote the data at any point. Nothing I had tried was working until I found Disk Drill, and after scanning for something like 15 minutes, I was finally able to see photos I hadn&#39;t seen in years. I was nearly to the point of tears. After looking through them on the program and selecting the ones I wanted to recover, I clicked the button to recover and was hit by this pop-up that said that I couldn&#39;t recover the images that I literally saw right on my screen unless I upgraded to the pro plan, which I can&#39;t afford. They could&#39;ve put the paywall at download or at least made it clear you couldn&#39;t do much of anything unless you got the pro plan, but instead they decided to dangle the recovered files in my face before telling me I couldn&#39;t have them unless I paid. At this point, it&#39;s basically glorified ransomware for files I accidentally deleted. It&#39;s one thing to have a paid file recovery program, but a whole other thing for one to act free (their website calls it a free app) and then make you pay when it&#39;s already loaded the files that you need to recover (it showed the thumbnails of the deleted files). Worst part is that Disk Drill isn&#39;t the only program doing this, this seems to be a trend.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I built a content aggregator called <a href=\"http://rewindbypaul.com\"><strong>ReWindByPaul.com</strong></a>. It handles RSS, Podcasts, and YouTube, but it has a specific feature called &quot;ReWind&quot; that handles content that has already been added in the past. It&#39;s entirely web-based.</p>\n\n<p>For those who don&#39;t know what RSS is (I knew what it was for years but never actually used it until I got interested in this project, and now I use it every day for my news consumption), RSS allows you to collect information, articles, or podcasts from various websites all in one place - a reader.</p>\n\n<p>The existing RSS readers I found felt overwhelming with too many options and complex settings. I just wanted something simple that works straight away, without needing a manual to set up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What makes my app different?</strong><br/>\nIt is, I hope, much simpler to use. It includes full podcast support, including a queue and an audio player. But it also has a unique feature that I haven&#39;t seen elsewhere. It&#39;s my own invention.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does the &quot;ReWind&quot; feature work?</strong><br/>\nIt sends you notifications about old content - for example, older YouTube videos, or older RSS items.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s say you discover a new YouTube channel. You like it, or maybe you want to re-watch videos from your favorite creator. But they have over 100 videos. You don&#39;t have time to watch them all right now, and realistically, you never will. My app answers this problem.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You simply choose:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Where to start:</strong> From the very beginning (the first video), or maybe just the last 50.</li>\n<li><strong>The interval:</strong> Every 1 to 7 days.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Then, every day (or every week, depending on your setting), you will receive these &quot;old&quot; videos in your <a href=\"http://rewindbypaul.com/userfeed\"><strong>ReWindByPaul.com/userfeed</strong></a> panel, as if they were new.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you find a history channel with hundreds of documentaries, you get the first one immediately, and then one video a day for the next 250 days. (Note: I limit YouTube archives to 250 items due to technical reasons).</p>\n\n<p><strong>If that sounds good, you can test these examples:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>60 Minutes</strong> (Famous news magazine): <a href=\"https://rewindbypaul.com/channel/yt/?link=68dab97a030e94470c1916cf\">Link</a></li>\n<li><strong>Macroblank</strong> (Cool music): <a href=\"https://rewindbypaul.com/channel/yt/?link=68d58251633c9c558fabd34e\">Link</a></li>\n<li><strong>The Jordan Harbinger Show</strong> (General interest podcast): <a href=\"https://rewindbypaul.com/channel/podcast/?link=691a5297f4549433ef5049d3\">Link</a></li>\n<li><strong>Noah Smith</strong> (Popular economic blogger): <a href=\"https://rewindbypaul.com/channel/rss/?link=691667e863caeed9af930803\">Link</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Or you can add your favorite stuff.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Regarding features:</strong><br/>\nI aimed for simplicity for regular users. It doesn&#39;t have AI summarization or complex nested folders right now - just a clean feed of the content you want, though you can filter it by RSS, Podcast, or YouTube.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>If this sounds interesting, please create an account and test it out:</strong><br/>\n<a href=\"https://rewindbypaul.com\">https://ReWindByPaul.com</a></p>\n\n<p>If you like it, you can support the project at <strong>ReWindByPaul.com/premium</strong>. Supporters get higher limits and no ads.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Roadmap:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Android App:</strong> Currently on the way. You can sign up for early access on the main page.</li>\n<li><strong>iOS App:</strong> In the future plans (you can express interest on the main page).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Feedback:</strong><br/>\nIn case of problems, suggestions, or questions about pricing/limits, you can send your feedback via <a href=\"http://rewindbypaul.com/reportproblem\"><strong>ReWindByPaul.com/reportproblem</strong></a>, email me at [<a href=\"mailto:rewindbypaul@gmail.com\">rewindbypaul@gmail.com</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:rewindbypaul@gmail.com\">rewindbypaul@gmail.com</a>), or at [<a href=\"mailto:contact@rewindbypaul.com\">contact@rewindbypaul.com</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:contact@rewindbypaul.com\">contact@rewindbypaul.com</a>).</p>\n\n<p>For the power users among you: if you like the ReWind feature, you can also create your own public curated collections of links that others can &quot;ReWind&quot; through.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for checking it out!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
