It also supports detecting leftovers from previously uninstalled software, and a lot of other powerful features. The full list of features is available at <a href=\"https://uninstalr.com/\">https://uninstalr.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>Here are some key improvements compared to the current official version (Uninstalr 2.8):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The installed apps list now shows the country of origin for all known installed apps.</li>\n<li>The listing of paths before uninstallation starts now displays checkboxes, allowing users to uncheck any paths the user doesn’t want to be removed.</li>\n<li>The program now uses less RAM and performs the scan for installed software on average 40% faster.</li>\n<li>The main window bar now includes Settings and About buttons.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please note that this is <em>not the final version</em>. It may still contain bugs, so testing it on a virtual machine is recommended. Also, please don’t share this build publicly or upload it to download sites.</p>\n\n<p>If you find any issues, please let me know so I can fix them before the official release. If you are reporting any issues relating to uninstalling any specific software, please tell me which software you were trying to uninstall when the issue occurred so I can try to reproduce the issue and fix it.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m the developer of Uninstalr, so you can send any feedback here as a comment or directly to me via a private message.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I ran a comparative case study between <strong>ZeroGPT</strong> and <a href=\"http://www.aiornot.com/\">AI or Not.</a></p>\n\n<p>The results were pretty damning for the industry standard.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Breakdown:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ZeroGPT (The Loser):</strong> It completely folded. The false positive rate was unacceptable, and classifications were inconsistent. It seems optimized for older GPT-3.5 patterns and fails when facing newer architectures. If you are relying on this for compliance, you are getting bad data.</li>\n<li><strong>AI or Not (The Winner):</strong> It successfully navigated the nuance of &quot;thinking&quot; model outputs without getting confused by the complex reasoning chains. It seems to analyze the <em>structure</em> of the reasoning rather than just surface-level perplexity.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Newer reasoning models (o1, Kimi) are bypassing perplexity-based detection. I&#39;m seeing a clear shift where structure-based analysis is required.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data:</strong> <em>(Note: Instead of just attaching a PDF, I recommend posting a screenshot of your results table here or pasting a snippet of the text that fooled ZeroGPT.
