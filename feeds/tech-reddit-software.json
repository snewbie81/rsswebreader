The core visual interface is working, and I&#39;m opening up a pre-order for the first 500 founding members before a public launch later this year.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d love to know:</p>\n\n<p>Does this concept resonate with you? Is a visual interface something you&#39;d use?</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s the first AI-powered tool or workflow you would try to build?</p>\n\n<p>For the developers here: What are the biggest pitfalls you foresee in a project like this?</p>\n\n<p>This is a passion project, and all feedback—the good, the bad, and the brutal—is incredibly valuable.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re interested in following the journey, you can check out a visual mockup and learn more on the Blokks Landing Page.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading!

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi! I’m not totally sure if this is the right forum for this, but I recently acquired a BD burner (Model No. CB31005) and have burned a few of my favorite hard-to-find films to Blu-ray discs ONLY for my personal use. I use Shutter Encoder to hardcode subtitles and convert .mkv to .mp4 in order to use Toast 17 Titanium w/ the Blu-Ray extension to burn the discs. There are no issues converting, but once the discs are burned, there is severe frame rate choppiness and un-synced audio. This problem doesn’t arise until playback (I use a PS5 to play my discs and typically have no issues with playback, including DVDs I’ve burned with DVDStyler, only the Blu-rays). If anyone can help me figure this out, I would be eternally grateful!</p>\n\n<p>Some additional information: I am working with a 2019 MacBook Pro (i7 chip, Tahoe 26.0.1) so unfortunately my options are limited when it comes to Blu-ray authoring software, as most seem to only work with Windows. Another issue I have with Toast is that it will crash whenever I select the “Edit” button for the files, so I don’t know if there are settings within that that’re causing the issues (a solution for this would also be great). Ideally I would upgrade to the newest version of Toast but they charge absurd amounts for updates. I use DVDStyler to burn DVDs with no problems but they don’t offer Blu-ray support. I can also provide more specific information in the comments if needed/requested! Thank you in advance! &lt;3</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>TLDR: advice on types of AI software to extract documents out of a set of folders based on a list for a course I&#39;m doing. Also to make a simple summary/explanation of each one. This can be the same software or two different ones. </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve started a course for senior construction management. The course mainly requires me to find workplace examples of certain project documents and procedures and provide details of my work based involvement. My experience to this point is site-based management and I have not actually set up most of these procedures or documents. I&#39;m looking for an AI or project document management system to automate the process of going through the project folders and finding documents that match the criteria of each part of the course and extracting them to a folder. I would then like it to summarize what the purpose of that document is. I can then add a short summary of how I&#39;ve been involved in the setting up of that document or providing detailed site information to complete the document. These could be two different solutions or one that does it all. </p>\n\n<p>Although this could be considered possibly cheating using AI or other software to complete part of my course, I disagree because I think the important element is the site based knowledge that goes into the documents and how they are used. Also I think it will be a useful way for me to learn modern management document systems and potentially new AI systems for future project management. I think the process of learning one of these systems to carry out the grunt work would be a better use of my time than trawling through project folders looking for documents that match the criteria. I also think that  just using my time to add my personal experience to each area or document is of more valuable use of my time. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve searched online and used AI to find DMS systems that maybe able to carry this out, but most of them are prohibitively expensive for the use case I have. I&#39;m happy to pay to use one of these systems, but don&#39;t want to pay for one and then realize it&#39;s not going to carry out what I need it to do. </p>\n\n<p>If anyone has any recommendations of software that might be able to do this, that would be greatly appreciated. Or comments on what I&#39;m I&#39;m trying to achieve. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
