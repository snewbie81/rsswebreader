The idea is: I source vintage items from Japan and ship them back to Vietnam, where my friend helps receive the packages and handle local shipping. His role is basically picking which items to import and coordinating deliveries. We’ve only been running this for three days, but the early numbers look pretty promising.</p>\n\n<p>The problem started when his close friend (they’ve known each other since middle school) suddenly decided to copy the exact same business model I’m doing. Then he invited my partner to join his new business.</p>\n\n<p>At first, that guy also asked me to team up with them, but I refused because he has a history of running away from debt and being involved in messy situations. I didn’t want to get tied up with someone like that.</p>\n\n<p>After I declined, my current partner’s attitude changed. He told me he “wants to talk about salary” and then said he’s been busy with school lately and wants to “focus on studying more.” It felt like he was slowly distancing himself after his friend offered him something.</p>\n\n<p>I’m just starting this business and already running into this kind of situation.
