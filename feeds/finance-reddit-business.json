But along the way i’ve been kind of stumped. In the process i’d say most people had somebody to vet , or look up to.I really don’t have that , I just have God and myself which is enough , but in this life you need the favor of man ,so who ever you are out there , please reach out if you are ding rather well for yourself and would like to pour into the youth!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
