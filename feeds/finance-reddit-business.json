I’m part of the founding team, and we created it because we kept losing track of messages ourselves. As freelancers and small business owners, chats hit you from all directions, like WhatsApp, Instagram, LinkedIn. In between all that chaos, important follow-ups or client requests often get buried. That’s why we built ChatMarker.</p>\n\n<p>With it, you get to label chats, pin conversations, add notes, and set reminders so nothing gets forgotten. For anyone juggling multiple platforms and projects, it’s like having a personal assistant for your messages. We’d love for you to give it a try and share your experience.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
