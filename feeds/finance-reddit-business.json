They are injected with saline, sugar and other chemicals and preservatives. I want to offer a healthier option. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been searching for examples of similar businesses  and have found only a few food trucks and several Hispanic or Peruvian style businesses that offer whole chickens. </p>\n\n<p>if you have thoughts on this model or know of a place like this in your area please comment. This is something I&#39;ve been thinking of doing for quite some time. I&#39;ve run the numbers and it appears to be a profitable venture. Please share your thoughts.
