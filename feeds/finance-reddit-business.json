My boss has been running it for years by himself, and is happy to sell it to me and a coworker. (She and I have been doing administrative stuff and teaching there for a few years). I would like advice on how to structure the business and what to do with investors (or if they are even a good idea). </p>\n\n<p>I think the business is currently an LLC, and my boss is the sole owner. I hear there is some risk in partnerships, and that it is safer for someone to have the responsibility of at least 51% of the business. My co-purchaser and I also talked about getting some investors to help with the initial purchasing costs. </p>\n\n<p>Before I get people telling me to get a lawyer and a banker and an accountant - I am setting up meetings with all three of these, and this is just my information gathering beforehand. I would like to go into these meetings with a better idea of what to expect and what questions to ask, specifically. </p>\n\n<p>What I want to know is... what are my options for a business structure? I can easily google the difference between an S corp and an LLC, etc, but what I mean is - what are the advantages of splitting things 50/50 vs 51/49 in a partnership? What about adding more people with business shares? Do you have to form a board if you have 3 people with some amount of ownership? What does having a board even entail? What if I give all the employees some small percentage of ownership too? What would they get from that? </p>\n\n<p>I am not the person trying to profit a bunch off of the business - I want to make sure all the employees win as well and that the school is able to grow and do well! I just don&#39;t know what all of my options are, and would love any advice you guys have. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
