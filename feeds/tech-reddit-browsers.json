This release focuses on making the new tab page feel more dynamic, more polished, and easier to customize.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s what’s new:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Daily Wallpaper : Your new tab now shows a different background every day, automatically.</li>\n<li>Adaptive Wallpapers : Wallpapers can now change depending on the time of day: morning, afternoon, evening, and night.</li>\n<li>New Wallpaper Collection : I’ve added several new wallpapers to give you more choices when customizing your page.</li>\n<li>Cleaner Interface : Category titles have been replaced with icons for a more modern and simple layout.</li>\n<li>Improved Home Assistant Setup : A new documentation page is now available to help you connect Home Sweet Home with Home Assistant easily.</li>\n<li>Bug Fixes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thanks to everyone who reported issues. Your feedback really helps.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve never heard of the extension before: Home Sweet Home is a small project I started recently, and it lets you customize your new tab page with widgets, your favorite links, custom icons, bookmarks, and even Home Assistant controls. It’s still modest in scale (about 45 users), but I’m doing my best to make it better update after update.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the links if you want to try it or update:</p>\n\n<p>Chrome: <a href=\"https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/home-sweet-home/hliapbikacikepiaojmphlhndgjmlodh\">https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/home-sweet-home/hliapbikacikepiaojmphlhndgjmlodh</a></p>\n\n<p>Edge: <a href=\"https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/home-sweet-home/dllgnjnckigifjgfiijdahnoohclacko\">https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/home-sweet-home/dllgnjnckigifjgfiijdahnoohclacko</a></p>\n\n<p>Firefox: <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/home-sweet-home/\">https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/home-sweet-home/</a></p>\n\n<p>If you have suggestions, ideas for new widgets, or anything else, I’d love to hear it.

Since I use Perplexity for financial research, I can just keep a tab open and be done with it.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, I value convenience, time saved, and synchronization far more than deep customization. And because I use both Apple and Microsoft devices, Safari doesn’t really work for me as a primary browser. Let’s be honest: you can’t really escape Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, and the rest unless you route everything through Tor.</p>\n\n<p>I also use Google services like Drive, Sheets, and Docs for my research, so having them tightly integrated with the browser is very convenient. I still go back to Zen from time to time because the tab-split feature is great when I need to read and write side by side, and its minimal interface is a pleasure to use.

I tried to follow them, and the module is copied into the app, but according to <a href=\"https://bitmovin.com/demos/drm/\">this</a> website and netflix, I still do not have a functioning drm module.
