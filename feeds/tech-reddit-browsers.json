Animals, items, concepts, etc. </p>\n\n<p>So back then I had the idea of &quot;what if the Fae had heard about web browsers. What would their conceptualization of these things be and how would the characters be designed?&quot; </p>\n\n<p>My character was literally Firefox. A flaming Fox, named Mo, that would go out and search for anything that others needed to find. He&#39;d use his animal senses to hunt, but the flames, while useful in combat, were because the Fae just didn&#39;t understand what Firefox was when it was described.</p>\n\n<p>Others that I had conceptualized included Safari, a fellow Hunter. Chrome, at the time was a polychromatic character. And Internet Explorer was an similar to Safari, but more of a traveler.</p>\n\n<p>That said, I&#39;m curious what character idea is others could come up with though and especially today. </p>\n\n<p>What does duckduckgo become as a character? Microsoft Edge? Zen browser? Opera? Libre Wolf? The list goes on. </p>\n\n<p>(If it helps here&#39;s a list of what character types were) \n* Beast (you&#39;re an animal)\n* Darkling (you go bump in the night) \n* Elemental (you became a literal Thing)\n* Fairest (you were taken as a treasure item) \n* Ogre (you survived by becoming like your Fae captors \n* Wizened (you were good at 1 thing, and it&#39;s your identity now)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have been using Edge for a while and love its open tab session (workspace) syncing, which lets me jump on any desktop or laptop and pick up where I left off.  I find it lacking in two keys areas, however:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It only has one layer of tabs and groups.  It would be great if it had functionality something like Firefox&#39;s Sidebery add-on, i.e. with both tree-style tabs and groups.</li>\n<li>It can be slow starting up.  I guess it is sorting out is sync status, but it can sometimes take a minute (even on a speedy internet connection and a decent PC) which is a pain when I want to get going.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I have had a good trawl but cannot find browser + add-on combo that will let me have it all.  I am hoping that Reddit will come to the rescue and tell me about a nice solution that I have missed.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I’ve been testing a few antidetect browsers lately because juggling multiple accounts in regular Chrome/Firefox was getting chaotic, and I figured I’d share my experience in case it helps anyone sitting in the same boat. </p>\n\n<p>GoLogin was the easiest to get started with super clean UI, simple setup, and cloud-stored profiles that sync nicely across devices. It handled basic fingerprint checks fine when the OS matched, though the spoofing feels more on the “lightweight” side if you need deep customization or automation. Pricing is around $24/month for 100 profiles, making it a decent fit for freelancers or anyone who wants privacy without enterprise-level complexity.</p>\n\n<p>AdsPower ended up feeling like the most flexible option overall. There’s a free tier, the paid plans start around $9/month for 10 profiles, and they include built-in proxy management and RPA tools, which makes multi-account work or scraping a lot easier. My only gripe is that the fingerprint system feels a bit template-based compared to the more advanced browsers. Still, if your priority is budget + lots of isolated profiles, it gets the job done.</p>\n\n<p>Linken Sphere is on the opposite end of the spectrum - extremely deep fingerprint customization, down to hardware patterns and encrypted local storage. It’s powerful, but definitely not beginner-friendly, and you need to manually handle proxies. Pricing supposedly starts around $30/month, but it scales fast, so it’s really only worth it if you need max control, stealth, or have more technical workflows.</p>\n\n<p>Then there’s MuLogin, which is great if you’re strictly on Windows and want everything handled locally instead of in the cloud. You can spin up a ton of profiles with full fingerprint-spoofing controls, and the UI is straightforward, though a bit heavy. The downsides are the lack of macOS/Linux support, not-so-intuitive automation setup, and a higher price point at around $59/month for 100 profiles. It’s best for Windows-only users who want full local control and don’t care about cross-device sync.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, if you want something simple and affordable without diving into technical setups, GoLogin and AdsPower offer the best balance. If stealth and fingerprint precision matter more than convenience, Linken Sphere or MuLogin give you the control you need, but they make you work for it. None of these are perfect, but whichever you use, pairing it with a decent proxy or VPN is non-negotiable, since even the best fingerprint masking falls apart if your IP/geo is mismatched.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
