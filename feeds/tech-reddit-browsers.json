I&#39;m a master student, and I&#39;m looking for a new browser.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, I used Chrome, then went to Zen, but due to Zen&#39;s terrible performance, I went back to Chrome. However, Chrome seems more and more sluggish in the past few months: some websites just freezes, the tabs sometimes take forever to load and last week, Chrome just reset itself: I lost all my tabs, all my logins, etc. </p>\n\n<p>(I don&#39;t think the problem is my PC, since I have an Intel i7, 512SSD and 32GB of RAM.)</p>\n\n<p>Searching for an alternative or better option to Chrome/Zen, I got to Brave or Firefox. I took some look in Vivaldi too, but the interface it&#39;s sooooo ugly. I know that Firefox has some issues with render some websites (also that DRM issue) and that Brave has all that crypto-stuff, but which would you recommend: Brave or Firefox?</p>\n\n<p>(Ps.: I don&#39;t think I care much about privacy since all my work is made inside GSuite, so Google already took all the data they can from me, lol)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Either way, Opera no longer Opera-ates (lmao) like it&#39;s supposed to on my S8. For obvious reasons. To be specific, the adblock is iffy when it wasn&#39;t before, VPN takes twenty years to load if it even does at all, among other things.</p>\n\n<p>I want to be able to keep my browsers consistent between devices, so I&#39;m willing to switch entirely from Opera to another browser that is able to operate on Android 9 and below. I don&#39;t need you to tell me how old that OS is, I just need recommendations for what will and won&#39;t work. Mostly what will.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m mainly looking for security, ease of use, easy and free VPN, adblock, tracker blocking, and easy tab management and grouping.

Luckily I had an .html file backup (export), which I want to import to my profile and then sync the bookmarks with my Google account. It imports without problems, but there is one problem—bookmarks from folders with the same names are merged into one folder, so the original folder structure is lost. This thing is very important to me, because I had multiple &quot;tree folders&quot; of different topics with subfolders with the same names in them, and now it&#39;s one big mess.</p>\n\n<p>The backup file is not corrupted—when looking at it in the browser, it shows all the folders and subfolders, and also when I imported the .html file into Firefox, the folder structure was like before.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve tried many different methods, such as:</p>\n\n<p>- importing bookmarks to another browser and then transferring data from it to Chrome</p>\n\n<p>- using various extensions; some of them were not working at all*</p>\n\n<p>- using a different (new) profile and a different computer</p>\n\n<p>- using another channel (Chrome Canary)</p>\n\n<p>Yes, probably I could add some unique number to the folders with the same names and preserve the original structure, but it would be very complicated and time-consuming due to the size (tens to hundreds of folders).</p>\n\n<p>* One extension showed promising results—the folder structure was preserved, but there was another problem: when I looked at the source code of the export I made after import with this extension, all bookmarks were added with the same timestamp (the original timestamp when the bookmark was added was lost, so this is also a no-go for me). The extension: <a href=\"http://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bookmark-importexport/gdhpeilfkeeajillmcncaelnppiakjhn\">chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bookmark-importexport/gdhpeilfkeeajillmcncaelnppiakjhn</a></p>\n\n<p>My other idea was to downgrade Chrome (install an older version) when this was working correctly, import bookmarks, update it, and then sync them to the Google account, but I don&#39;t know how to do it.</p>\n\n<p>Do you have any other suggestions or ideas on how to fix this problem? Thanks in advance.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
