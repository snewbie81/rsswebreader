      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I’ve been testing a few antidetect browsers lately because juggling multiple accounts in regular Chrome/Firefox was getting chaotic, and I figured I’d share my experience in case it helps anyone sitting in the same boat. </p>\n\n<p>GoLogin was the easiest to get started with super clean UI, simple setup, and cloud-stored profiles that sync nicely across devices. It handled basic fingerprint checks fine when the OS matched, though the spoofing feels more on the “lightweight” side if you need deep customization or automation. Pricing is around $24/month for 100 profiles, making it a decent fit for freelancers or anyone who wants privacy without enterprise-level complexity.</p>\n\n<p>AdsPower ended up feeling like the most flexible option overall. There’s a free tier, the paid plans start around $9/month for 10 profiles, and they include built-in proxy management and RPA tools, which makes multi-account work or scraping a lot easier. My only gripe is that the fingerprint system feels a bit template-based compared to the more advanced browsers. Still, if your priority is budget + lots of isolated profiles, it gets the job done.</p>\n\n<p>Linken Sphere is on the opposite end of the spectrum - extremely deep fingerprint customization, down to hardware patterns and encrypted local storage. It’s powerful, but definitely not beginner-friendly, and you need to manually handle proxies. Pricing supposedly starts around $30/month, but it scales fast, so it’s really only worth it if you need max control, stealth, or have more technical workflows.</p>\n\n<p>Then there’s MuLogin, which is great if you’re strictly on Windows and want everything handled locally instead of in the cloud. You can spin up a ton of profiles with full fingerprint-spoofing controls, and the UI is straightforward, though a bit heavy. The downsides are the lack of macOS/Linux support, not-so-intuitive automation setup, and a higher price point at around $59/month for 100 profiles. It’s best for Windows-only users who want full local control and don’t care about cross-device sync.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, if you want something simple and affordable without diving into technical setups, GoLogin and AdsPower offer the best balance. If stealth and fingerprint precision matter more than convenience, Linken Sphere or MuLogin give you the control you need, but they make you work for it. None of these are perfect, but whichever you use, pairing it with a decent proxy or VPN is non-negotiable, since even the best fingerprint masking falls apart if your IP/geo is mismatched.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey all,<br/>\nI’m working on <strong>Beam</strong>, a new iPad browser inspired by Arc’s organisation model and UX. I wanted to share it here and open up the waitlist - but also be really clear about what it is, <em>why</em> it exists, and who it’s actually for.</p>\n\n<h1>Why Beam exists</h1>\n\n<p>If you use Arc on Mac, you know how powerful the whole model is - sidebar, spaces, command bar, recent tabs, profiles, distraction-free modes, etc.<br/>\nOn iPad, nothing feels close. Safari is great for most people, but it doesn’t give you that same “browser as your workspace” structure. Arc Search is fast but super minimal and doesn’t bring over the Mac experience.</p>\n\n<p>Beam exists for the small group of people who want <em>Arc-like workflow and tab organisation</em> on iPadOS - not a generic browser, but something opinionated and productivity-focused.</p>\n\n<h1>How Beam is different</h1>\n\n<p>Beam is not trying to compete with Safari or Chrome. It’s built around a few specific ideas:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Permanent sidebar</strong> instead of tabs</li>\n<li><strong>Spaces</strong> for separating work, school, and projects</li>\n<li><strong>Command bar</strong> (cmd + T) with actions, not just search</li>\n<li><strong>Pinned tabs with memory offloading</strong> (like Arc)</li>\n<li><strong>Content blocking</strong>, custom site settings, picture-in-picture style background audio</li>\n<li><strong>Profiles</strong>, light/dark themes, Liquid Glass UI, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Apple Foundation Models support</strong> for small, quiet AI actions</li>\n<li>Designed around <strong>iPad keyboard workflows</strong> - <em>but everything still works perfectly with touch too</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It’s basically: <em>If Arc existed on iPad, what would it look like?</em></p>\n\n<h1>Why it won’t be free forever</h1>\n\n<p>Being upfront: after the beta period, I’m planning to charge <strong>a one-time $4.99</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>A few reasons, before anyone jumps in with “why would I pay for a browser?”:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It’s a fully indie project - no ads, no data collection, no telemetry</li>\n<li>Building a browser on iPadOS is way harder than a typical app</li>\n<li>I want to keep it sustainable without subscriptions</li>\n<li>One-time pricing means no lock-in, no ecosystem gimmicks, no upsell</li>\n<li>Most people will stick with Safari - this is for a niche group who <em>care deeply</em> about a certain workflow</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>During the <strong>entire private beta and public beta, Beam will be completely free</strong>.<br/>\nNo charge until it’s stable, feature-complete, and actually worth paying for.</p>\n\n<p>It’s also totally fine if you don’t want to pay - Safari exists and is great for 99% of people. Beam is for that 1% who really want an Arc-like workspace on iPad.</p>\n\n<h1>Who Beam is not for</h1>\n\n<p>Trying to be upfront here, because negative comments come when expectations don’t match reality:</p>\n\n<p>✔️ <strong>For you if:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You use your iPad as a laptop replacement</li>\n<li>You live in your browser</li>\n<li>You rely on shortcuts, sidebars, and fast switching</li>\n<li>You want better tab organisation than Safari offers</li>\n<li>You liked Arc on Mac and want something closer on iPad</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>❌ <strong>Probably not for you if:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You prefer a simple, no-frills browser</li>\n<li>You don’t use a Magic Keyboard (it still works with touch - it’s just less of a “superpower” workflow)</li>\n<li>You want Chrome extensions on iPad (not possible)</li>\n<li>You mainly browse casually and don’t care about workspace organisation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Beam is intentionally opinionated - it won’t suit everyone, and that’s fine.</p>\n\n<h1>If you want to join the waitlist</h1>\n\n<p>I’m opening up the testing list as I get closer to the private beta.<br/>\nIf you want to try it or give feedback:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://beambrowser.app\"><strong>beambrowser.app</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>Would love feedback, feature ideas, or even scepticism.<br/>\nHappy to answer any questions!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
