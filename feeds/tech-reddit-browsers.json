I erased about 28 months of history, thousands upon of thousands of entries, other cached bloat, as well as dumb cookies. }</p>\n\n<p>Then I got the idea that all of those history junk and other cached stuff are pointless. Usually when I find something interesting I drop a bookmark based on current YEAR/MONTH. However when I need to &quot;remember&quot; something I visited, my working memory is only about 2 weeks or so, there&#39;s no chance I remember something I visited 2 months ago or even further before.</p>\n\n<p>This is how I got the idea to get an *auto history cleaner* that can delete stuff older than 30 days. Also other times I need to *pause history* and look up things without registering them at all.</p>\n\n<p>As for example I might *pause history* and watch a video about politics or other controversial stuff without ruining my recommendations list and stuff. Or if for example I visit a store to buy something, then I won&#39;t need again the history search times to pop up and bloat my menus. Also less entries, more lightweight the database.  </p>\n\n<p>Addons:<br/>\n• History On/Off<br/>\n• History Cleaner (history-cleaner/epoabannnmjdknejdggkgjoebomipene)</p>\n\n<p>I am about two months now with this and it seems very useful. Later on I might experiment further with auto cleaning cache and cookies. Probably get different addons? Or something else that has all-in-one? I will see.</p>\n\n<p>I just have this recommendation if you like it, give it a thumbs up. Also drop your suggestions as well if you know anything better.  </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have been using Brave for many years without issues, but for the past few weeks whenever I use it to download files from MEGA, MEGA would sometimes pause midway to tell me to free up space. Now if anyone of you are familiar with MEGA, you know that it does not download the file directly and instead, downloads the whole file on a webpage (it writes to the browser&#39;s cache directory) before your choose a location to store that file (move cache to the destination folder). The issue with this way of downloading is that cache sometimes does not get deleted after file downloads, so you would have a massive data folder in brave&#39;s installation directory.</p>\n\n<p>I still have 15G left on my C drive so in theory this shouldn&#39;t be a problem (I always download to drive D and E, never drive C), but since this error keeps popping up, yesterday I decided to move Brave&#39;s entire data folder to drive D, which has more than 1T available. And this is when the nightmare starts.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>According to Google and even Brave themselves, this is where brave&#39;s data folder resides: C:\\Users\\&lt;Username&gt;\\AppData\\Local\\BraveSoftware\\Brave-Browser\\User Data. This folder contains your browsing history, sessions/tabs opened, bookmarks, everything. So all I have to do is to map this to a folder on drive D, right? Well sort of. After some failed attempts I was able to create a symbolic link that connects this folder to a folder on drive D. Once the link is correctly established, everything started working as they should, history is there, tabs are there. If the link isn’t done properly then I lose history, tabs, passwords, etc. basically all user data. That’s how I know the link works. Well, everything works, except when I download from MEGA it still writes to C drive.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>So I pulled up resource monitor to see where all that traffic is going, and when Brave downloads I can see it writing to a folder called data in Brave&#39;s installation directory, in my case C:\\SW\\Brave\\data, this is the location where I installed brave, and brave seems to keep cache here instead of the aforementioned users/appdata folder. But the confusing thing is, the contents in this folder is nearly identical to the aforementioned appdata folder. File and folder names were the same, even folder size were similar. I have never seen a browser keeping 2 identical copies of user data, but oh well. I created another symbolic link that redirects cache to drive D, and this time MEGA is finally writing to Drive D.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Looking back I really wish I could have stopped here, but I was just too curious. I have never seen a browser keeping 2 identical copies of user data in different locations. I was not using any backup software, nor do I have windows restore point enabled, and that rules out the possibility of windows doing the backup for me. Everything tells me that one of the two folders isn’t being used.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>So, you guessed it, I deleted C:\\SW\\Brave\\data first, thinking it was this folder. Got a brave window with no prior sessions, tabs or history. Must be the other folder I thought, so I restored this folder and deleted the other one, and I was again greeted with the same blank page. I restored both folders, and guess what? Everything came back, the booksmarks, the history, the extensions, all there. Except the tabs. Before I started this whole thing I have 3 windows opened with around 40 tabs, and now they are gone.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>I spent the next 9 hours frantically googling, and came back with the reality that my tabs are really and truly, gone. Like a puff of smoke, never to be retrieved ever again. Brave stores your sessions in &lt;brave install directory&gt;\\data\\Default\\Sessions, in my case, C:\\SW\\Brave\\data\\Default\\Sessions. The unfortunate reality is they only keep 2 sessions. Your current session and your last session. What that means is, in the event of a crash, if you fail to restore the tabs (by clicking the restore last sessions button on the top right) and close Brave, your sessions are gone. Brave will overwrite the session files and no file recovery software will ever be able to retrieve these files ever again, because these files were not deleted, they were overwritten. If you have a hard drive there’s maybe a 0.5% chance that you can retrieve them. If like every laptop these days you have SSD, they are gone. TRIM makes sure everything that isn’t needed is wiped. You can put a person in there and the moment he isn’t needed he would dematerialize.  </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>I have learnt my lesson. I have installed a session manager plugin that saves all my sessions at regular intervals, both locally and on cloud. I have made sure that I will never have another session/tab-related nightmare ever again, and I advise every chromium-based browser user to do the same, get an extension that backs up your tabs locally and on cloud at regular intervals. What happened today ruined my weekend, but it doesn’t have to ruin yours.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>To all the lost windows and tabs, I bid you farewell. You fought brilliantly on the forefront before losing to developer neglect and corporate incompetence. May we cross path again.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>To developers of chrome and all chromium-based browsers, for years a blue &#39;restore session&#39; button is all there is that separates a tiny island of hope from an unfathomable ocean of despair. The presence of such button inspires awe while the absence of it struck the deepest level of fear and terror. During these years, gigabytes have become terabytes, dialups have given way to fiber. Is it not finally time for you to move on from archiving a meager 2 sessions to the at least 200? Can us users finally not have to worry about losing all our cherished memories to the push of a button?</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: brave browser using 2 folders in separate locations to store identical user data, including history, extensions, sessions, etc. Suspect one is not in use. Tried relocating both folders and was fine. Then tried deleting either of them. Lost all my tabs/sessions but not anything else. Despair. Installed tabs manager to prevent similar disasters. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
