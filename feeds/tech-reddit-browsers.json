One is up to date (Google Pixel 6) and the other is stuck in 2018 (Galaxy S8).</p>\n\n<p>Opera is no longer compatible with Android 9 or below. I think I heard it was because of Chromium stuff. Either way, Opera no longer Opera-ates (lmao) like it&#39;s supposed to on my S8. For obvious reasons. To be specific, the adblock is iffy when it wasn&#39;t before, VPN takes twenty years to load if it even does at all, among other things.</p>\n\n<p>I want to be able to keep my browsers consistent between devices, so I&#39;m willing to switch entirely from Opera to another browser that is able to operate on Android 9 and below. I don&#39;t need you to tell me how old that OS is, I just need recommendations for what will and won&#39;t work. Mostly what will.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m mainly looking for security, ease of use, easy and free VPN, adblock, tracker blocking, and easy tab management and grouping. I would prefer something that isn&#39;t shoving AI in my face, but I&#39;ll take what I can get. Also, customization isn&#39;t a priority.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for reading!

Luckily I had an .html file backup (export), which I want to import to my profile and then sync the bookmarks with my Google account. It imports without problems, but there is one problem—bookmarks from folders with the same names are merged into one folder, so the original folder structure is lost. This thing is very important to me, because I had multiple &quot;tree folders&quot; of different topics with subfolders with the same names in them, and now it&#39;s one big mess.</p>\n\n<p>The backup file is not corrupted—when looking at it in the browser, it shows all the folders and subfolders, and also when I imported the .html file into Firefox, the folder structure was like before.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve tried many different methods, such as:</p>\n\n<p>- importing bookmarks to another browser and then transferring data from it to Chrome</p>\n\n<p>- using various extensions; some of them were not working at all*</p>\n\n<p>- using a different (new) profile and a different computer</p>\n\n<p>- using another channel (Chrome Canary)</p>\n\n<p>Yes, probably I could add some unique number to the folders with the same names and preserve the original structure, but it would be very complicated and time-consuming due to the size (tens to hundreds of folders).</p>\n\n<p>* One extension showed promising results—the folder structure was preserved, but there was another problem: when I looked at the source code of the export I made after import with this extension, all bookmarks were added with the same timestamp (the original timestamp when the bookmark was added was lost, so this is also a no-go for me). The extension: <a href=\"http://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bookmark-importexport/gdhpeilfkeeajillmcncaelnppiakjhn\">chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bookmark-importexport/gdhpeilfkeeajillmcncaelnppiakjhn</a></p>\n\n<p>My other idea was to downgrade Chrome (install an older version) when this was working correctly, import bookmarks, update it, and then sync them to the Google account, but I don&#39;t know how to do it.</p>\n\n<p>Do you have any other suggestions or ideas on how to fix this problem?

Now every platform freaks out over the smallest move and flags you instantly.</p>\n\n<p>I even tried logging in with a private proxy the other day and still got thrown straight into a checkpoint. The good old “just switch a proxy and you’re fine” days are pretty much gone.</p>\n\n<p>Technically you don’t have to use an antidetect browser, but it’s getting really close to being a necessity. Platforms aren’t just checking your IP anymore. They look at your whole digital identity and whether everything lines up.</p>\n\n<p>I saw a similar case on the KocerRoxy blog. Stuff that works today might be useless tomorrow. The real challenge is finding a setup where all your tools work together instead of messing each other up.</p>\n\n<p>I’m managing multiple accounts across different platforms, mostly large MMO accounts, and regular browsers just don’t cut it now. Even with proxies, if you don’t isolate fingerprints properly you get flagged pretty fast.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why I started testing antidetect browsers to see if they handle heavy use any better.</p>\n\n<p>I tried AdsPower. The trial only gives you 2 profiles. The price for 100 profiles is 21.6 dollars, which is pretty reasonable. Their virtual browser gives each profile its own hardware parameters, canvas, timezone, fonts and all that. From my testing, reopening the same profile keeps the fingerprint consistent, which matters a lot because fingerprint drift is usually what triggers flags. Some profiles do take a bit longer to open and my local machine stutters here and there, but it is still workable.</p>\n\n<p>I’m curious if anyone here has actually used these tools long term with good results, or if this whole thing is just hype.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

She’s not an enthusiast or anything, she just trusts it, likes the look, and feels comfortable with it. My dad, on the other hand, is fully in the Chromium ecosystem. He switches between Brave and Chrome depending on work. Normally this shouldn’t matter, but it’s somehow become a point of friction between them.</p>\n\n<p>It started with small comments like my dad joking that Firefox is slow, my mom saying Chromium “tracks everything”   </p>\n\n<p>Just harmless stuff. But lately they’ve been arguing more than usual, and for some reason the browser thing keeps coming up during those arguments. I know it’s not actually about the browsers… but it’s what they keep using to take shots at each other</p>\n\n<p>Two nights ago, my mom told me she’s tired of feeling like her choices get dismissed at home, even for “something as basic as what browser I use”  </p>\n\n<p>My dad told me he feels like she’s “stuck in the past” again referring to the browser.</p>\n\n<p>I’m stuck in the middle because I’ve been quietly using Comet Browser for a few months. AI browsers aren’t something they like they think it’s “overkill” or “gimmicky.” So I’ve just kept it to myself. And now with all this tension, I honestly don’t even want to bring it up. It sounds so stupid typing it out, but I’m genuinely stressed.</p>\n\n<p>It feels like it’s not about tech anymore. They’re projecting other frustrations onto it, but the browser stuff is the part they keep latching onto. I don’t know whether to sit them down and tell them it’s all getting blown out of proportion or if it’s not my place.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone else dealt with something like this?<br/>\nHow do you even approach a situation where the <em>surface argument</em> is something trivial, but the emotions underneath are real?</p>\n\n<p>I don’t want to make it worse by saying the wrong things</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

For example, they recently added a hidden empty div over YouTube videos that causes our hardware acceleration fast-path to bail (should now be fixed in Win10 Oct update). Prior to that, our fairly state-of-the-art video acceleration put us well ahead of Chrome on video playback time on battery, but almost the instant they broke things on YouTube, they started advertising Chrome&#39;s dominance over Edge on video-watching battery life. What makes it so sad, is that their claimed dominance was not due to ingenious optimization work by Chrome, but due to a failure of YouTube. On the whole, they only made the web slower.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is from true dev of EdgeHTML, not even stranger, we need a big wiki to collect all the evidences, because people are fast to forget.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Suggest me a good browser.</p>\n\n<p>(My daily tasks: Running figma, framer, netflix, youtube, a little bit surfing) </p>\n\n<p>P.s. ik you can use apps for them, but i like using websites for those tasks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
