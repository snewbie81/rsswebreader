Your feedback really helps.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve never heard of the extension before: Home Sweet Home is a small project I started recently, and it lets you customize your new tab page with widgets, your favorite links, custom icons, bookmarks, and even Home Assistant controls. It’s still modest in scale (about 45 users), but I’m doing my best to make it better update after update.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the links if you want to try it or update:</p>\n\n<p>Chrome: <a href=\"https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/home-sweet-home/hliapbikacikepiaojmphlhndgjmlodh\">https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/home-sweet-home/hliapbikacikepiaojmphlhndgjmlodh</a></p>\n\n<p>Edge: <a href=\"https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/home-sweet-home/dllgnjnckigifjgfiijdahnoohclacko\">https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/home-sweet-home/dllgnjnckigifjgfiijdahnoohclacko</a></p>\n\n<p>Firefox: <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/home-sweet-home/\">https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/home-sweet-home/</a></p>\n\n<p>If you have suggestions, ideas for new widgets, or anything else, I’d love to hear it.

I’ve used Firefox, Zen, Arc, Surf, Brave, Comet, and even Edge. Comet was my go-to when it launched, but I quickly grew out of it. Since I use Perplexity for financial research, I can just keep a tab open and be done with it.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, I value convenience, time saved, and synchronization far more than deep customization. And because I use both Apple and Microsoft devices, Safari doesn’t really work for me as a primary browser. Let’s be honest: you can’t really escape Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, and the rest unless you route everything through Tor.</p>\n\n<p>I also use Google services like Drive, Sheets, and Docs for my research, so having them tightly integrated with the browser is very convenient. I still go back to Zen from time to time because the tab-split feature is great when I need to read and write side by side, and its minimal interface is a pleasure to use. The downside is that Zen is still in beta, so I run into a lot of bugs, sometimes almost daily, but once it gets a full release I might seriously consider switching back to it.</p>\n\n<p>I’m always open to suggestions and feedback.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

The browser is open and all but I can&#39;t do anything on it for some time until it &quot;fixes&quot; itself. That&#39;s why I looked for other browsers and found Helium. Yes... yes... I know... Helium AGAIN?? Well... Chromium is king, right??\nWell anyways I just use it whenever I&#39;m doing some simple task like watching YouTube or jusr browsing some social media stuff, not really for &quot;work tasks&quot; because I still use Vivaldi for that. But the &quot;hanging&quot; issue is really annoying whenever I need to use Vivaldi... That&#39;s why I looked for some browsers that have that vertical tabs because I love my &quot;Arc galzing&quot; nature.</p>\n\n<p>I found Zen and Floorp, I heard they have vertical tabs, and yes, they actually do which is nice but for Floorp, I am not sure why maybe it&#39;s because I haven&#39;t configured it well/correctly but its way of doing the vertical tabs is kinda bad. For Zen... hmm.. it&#39;s just that my extensions are misplaced like I have no idea why they are not inside the &quot;entension manager&quot; and just floating in my header thankfully its hidden but its still annoying to see whenever I&#39;m about to close the browser. Also, some mods doesn&#39;t work for me... like the Translucent one... mainly the translucent one... I even tried some tutorials about editing its css or something still to no avail. I like the idea of both browsers but I also want to hear from you guys which do you prefer and also what other cons hopefully pros you guys have on those 2 browsers.</p>\n\n<p>I also checked some browsers like Brave but I never liked it for some reason... I like the &quot;Ask Brave&quot; though. It&#39;s actually my main search engine for all my browsers. I also tried edge but uhh memories keeps coming back on why I dont want to use Edge but I heard its good now... I just refuse to use it still... I also tried Firefox but uhh after I upgraded my laptop and stopped using Linux, I really don&#39;t want to remember my Linux days anymore so I said nope to it. Kinda crazy how Zen and Floorp are both base on Firefox but at least they don&#39;t have &quot;Firefox&quot; on their names. I also have Comet but uhh.. seriously, who tf uses Comet as their daily driver? </p>\n\n<p>Anyways.. I&#39;m sorry for writing this long ass message. I just don&#39;t want to be that guy who asks &quot;which x browser is great&quot;. I also want to explain my side. That&#39;s all. Thanks. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Dear All,</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m a bit running out of memory, my 16GByte are often a bit stretched to the limit. Chrome is currently my main browser (plus Edge for work), and its always the app with the most memory usage. For example, currently 3 GByte for 3 windows with in total 27 Tabs (many not too complicated, e.g. Directory Opus forums) across all windows.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s what I could think of right now which is important to me:</p>\n\n<p>- <strong>Noticeably less memory usage. I&#39;m happy with pages being &#39;unloaded&#39; or not updated until I click on the tab again</strong>. Just to note, this is the most important point, the reason why I&#39;m considering to change.</p>\n\n<p>- Since I used Chrome for ages, the new browser should be able to import all website login-data</p>\n\n<p>- I&#39;d like an Adblocker, currently using uBlock Origin Lite on Chrome</p>\n\n<p>- The extension &quot;I still don&#39;t care about cookies&quot; is needed as well (or similar)</p>\n\n<p>- Availability of Zotero plug-in is essential</p>\n\n<p>- I liked the tab groups in the left toolbar of Sarari, that works much better for me than the way Chrome does the tab groups. I tried the extension tabVertical, but didn&#39;t like it.</p>\n\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\n\n<p>Andre</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
