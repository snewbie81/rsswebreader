My attempts so far:</p>\n\n<p>Opening the page in IE Mode on Edge → macro cannot detect the page, still gives: &quot;Please open the eReferral page in IE first.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Trying Selenium/Edge automation → works only by opening a new browser, but I really need the macro to work with the page already open like before.</p>\n\n<p>Enabling Internet Explorer in Windows Features → opening IE redirects automatically to Edge, so the macro still cannot detect the IE window.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, the macro relies on the old IE COM object, and there seems to be no way to connect to an already open page in Edge or IE Mode.</p>\n\n<p>Question: Is there any way to:</p>\n\n<p>Re-enable a “real” Internet Explorer on Windows 10/11 so that VBA COM automation works like before?

I&#39;m a master student, and I&#39;m looking for a new browser.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, I used Chrome, then went to Zen, but due to Zen&#39;s terrible performance, I went back to Chrome. However, Chrome seems more and more sluggish in the past few months: some websites just freezes, the tabs sometimes take forever to load and last week, Chrome just reset itself: I lost all my tabs, all my logins, etc. </p>\n\n<p>(I don&#39;t think the problem is my PC, since I have an Intel i7, 512SSD and 32GB of RAM.)</p>\n\n<p>Searching for an alternative or better option to Chrome/Zen, I got to Brave or Firefox. I took some look in Vivaldi too, but the interface it&#39;s sooooo ugly. I know that Firefox has some issues with render some websites (also that DRM issue) and that Brave has all that crypto-stuff, but which would you recommend: Brave or Firefox?</p>\n\n<p>(Ps.: I don&#39;t think I care much about privacy since all my work is made inside GSuite, so Google already took all the data they can from me, lol)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
