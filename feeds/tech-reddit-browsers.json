      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I’ve been testing different antidetect browsers lately because I needed something that could handle multiple accounts without mixing cookies, fingerprints, or browsing environments. AdsPower kept coming up, so I tried using it for a while. Here’s my honest take based on what I’ve seen while using it.</p>\n\n<p>Performance &amp; stability</p>\n\n<p>AdsPower’s whole thing is creating separate “browser profiles” that isolate cookies, local storage, fingerprints, and other identifiers. According to the official documentation, each profile runs in its own independent browser environment and generates its own device fingerprint.</p>\n\n<p>In real use, that means each profile basically behaves like a standalone Chromium instance. When I run several profiles at once, it works fine, but obviously the resource usage stacks because that’s just how multiple Chromium windows behave, not an AdsPower-specific issue.</p>\n\n<p>UI &amp; usability </p>\n\n<p>The interface matches what the website shows, including a dashboard for managing profiles, proxy management, team collaboration, automation tools, and extension settings.</p>\n\n<p>Creating a profile follows the official workflow: choose or generate a fingerprint, set up proxy info, select the browser core, and save. Nothing hidden or mysterious, just a lot of settings if you’re new to these tools. </p>\n\n<p>Features</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Fingerprint management It supports: Canvas, WebGL, AudioContext, timezone, language, font lists, geolocation and hardware info. You can either generate fingerprints automatically or import your own. </p></li>\n<li><p>Profile isolation Each profile has its own separate cookie jar and storage. AdsPower explicitly says profiles act like independent devices. </p></li>\n<li><p>Proxy integration The app supports multiple proxy types - HTTP, SOCKS5, SSH - exactly as stated on the website. </p></li>\n<li><p>Automation / RPA AdsPower includes an official “Robotic Process Automation” tool with a visual editor and support for recording actions. Their docs mention that workflows can be repeated across profiles. </p></li>\n<li><p>Team collaboration Teams can share profiles, assign roles, and set permissions. This is a documented feature.</p></li>\n<li><p>Extension support </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>AdsPower supports extensions for both Chromium-based profiles and Firefox-kernel profiles. I’ve tested Chrome extensions in Chromium profiles and Firefox add-ons in the Firefox ones, both worked as expected. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Pros</strong> </p>\n\n<p>- Fingerprint control is detailed and adjustable </p>\n\n<p>- Profile isolation works as advertised </p>\n\n<p>- Built-in automation saves time for repetitive tasks </p>\n\n<p>- Chrome/Firefox extension support </p>\n\n<p>- Centralized dashboard for proxies and profiles </p>\n\n<p>- Team-friendly workflow system </p>\n\n<p><strong>Cons</strong> </p>\n\n<p>- Because each profile is a Chromium-based browser core, opening many at once consumes a lot of system resources </p>\n\n<p>- The amount of fingerprint settings can feel overwhelming for beginners, and there’s a learning curve before everything makes sense</p>\n\n<p>- Not meant for casual browsing. This is a work tool, not a replacement for your main browser</p>\n\n<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you actually need an antidetect browser for things like multi-account workflows, AdsPower does what its documentation promises: isolated environments, fingerprint customization, automation, and team sharing. It’s not buggy or shady, just has a lot of features and settings because that’s what this kind of browser is for.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re just trying to avoid tracking in your normal daily browsing, this isn’t the right tool for that. It’s definitely more of a “professional/operations” type product.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
