      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I’ve been testing a few antidetect browsers lately because juggling multiple accounts in regular Chrome/Firefox was getting chaotic, and I figured I’d share my experience in case it helps anyone sitting in the same boat. </p>\n\n<p>GoLogin was the easiest to get started with super clean UI, simple setup, and cloud-stored profiles that sync nicely across devices. It handled basic fingerprint checks fine when the OS matched, though the spoofing feels more on the “lightweight” side if you need deep customization or automation. Pricing is around $24/month for 100 profiles, making it a decent fit for freelancers or anyone who wants privacy without enterprise-level complexity.</p>\n\n<p>AdsPower ended up feeling like the most flexible option overall. There’s a free tier, the paid plans start around $9/month for 10 profiles, and they include built-in proxy management and RPA tools, which makes multi-account work or scraping a lot easier. My only gripe is that the fingerprint system feels a bit template-based compared to the more advanced browsers. Still, if your priority is budget + lots of isolated profiles, it gets the job done.</p>\n\n<p>Linken Sphere is on the opposite end of the spectrum - extremely deep fingerprint customization, down to hardware patterns and encrypted local storage. It’s powerful, but definitely not beginner-friendly, and you need to manually handle proxies. Pricing supposedly starts around $30/month, but it scales fast, so it’s really only worth it if you need max control, stealth, or have more technical workflows.</p>\n\n<p>Then there’s MuLogin, which is great if you’re strictly on Windows and want everything handled locally instead of in the cloud. You can spin up a ton of profiles with full fingerprint-spoofing controls, and the UI is straightforward, though a bit heavy. The downsides are the lack of macOS/Linux support, not-so-intuitive automation setup, and a higher price point at around $59/month for 100 profiles. It’s best for Windows-only users who want full local control and don’t care about cross-device sync.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, if you want something simple and affordable without diving into technical setups, GoLogin and AdsPower offer the best balance. If stealth and fingerprint precision matter more than convenience, Linken Sphere or MuLogin give you the control you need, but they make you work for it. None of these are perfect, but whichever you use, pairing it with a decent proxy or VPN is non-negotiable, since even the best fingerprint masking falls apart if your IP/geo is mismatched.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey all,<br/>\nI’m working on <strong>Beam</strong>, a new iPad browser inspired by Arc’s organisation model and UX. I wanted to share it here and open up the waitlist - but also be really clear about what it is, <em>why</em> it exists, and who it’s actually for.</p>\n\n<h1>Why Beam exists</h1>\n\n<p>If you use Arc on Mac, you know how powerful the whole model is - sidebar, spaces, command bar, recent tabs, profiles, distraction-free modes, etc.<br/>\nOn iPad, nothing feels close. Safari is great for most people, but it doesn’t give you that same “browser as your workspace” structure. Arc Search is fast but super minimal and doesn’t bring over the Mac experience.</p>\n\n<p>Beam exists for the small group of people who want <em>Arc-like workflow and tab organisation</em> on iPadOS - not a generic browser, but something opinionated and productivity-focused.</p>\n\n<h1>How Beam is different</h1>\n\n<p>Beam is not trying to compete with Safari or Chrome. It’s built around a few specific ideas:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Permanent sidebar</strong> instead of tabs</li>\n<li><strong>Spaces</strong> for separating work, school, and projects</li>\n<li><strong>Command bar</strong> (cmd + T) with actions, not just search</li>\n<li><strong>Pinned tabs with memory offloading</strong> (like Arc)</li>\n<li><strong>Content blocking</strong>, custom site settings, picture-in-picture style background audio</li>\n<li><strong>Profiles</strong>, light/dark themes, Liquid Glass UI, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Apple Foundation Models support</strong> for small, quiet AI actions</li>\n<li>Designed around <strong>iPad keyboard workflows</strong> - <em>but everything still works perfectly with touch too</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It’s basically: <em>If Arc existed on iPad, what would it look like?</em></p>\n\n<h1>Why it won’t be free forever</h1>\n\n<p>Being upfront: after the beta period, I’m planning to charge <strong>a one-time $4.99</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>A few reasons, before anyone jumps in with “why would I pay for a browser?”:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It’s a fully indie project - no ads, no data collection, no telemetry</li>\n<li>Building a browser on iPadOS is way harder than a typical app</li>\n<li>I want to keep it sustainable without subscriptions</li>\n<li>One-time pricing means no lock-in, no ecosystem gimmicks, no upsell</li>\n<li>Most people will stick with Safari - this is for a niche group who <em>care deeply</em> about a certain workflow</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>During the <strong>entire private beta and public beta, Beam will be completely free</strong>.<br/>\nNo charge until it’s stable, feature-complete, and actually worth paying for.</p>\n\n<p>It’s also totally fine if you don’t want to pay - Safari exists and is great for 99% of people. Beam is for that 1% who really want an Arc-like workspace on iPad.</p>\n\n<h1>Who Beam is not for</h1>\n\n<p>Trying to be upfront here, because negative comments come when expectations don’t match reality:</p>\n\n<p>✔️ <strong>For you if:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You use your iPad as a laptop replacement</li>\n<li>You live in your browser</li>\n<li>You rely on shortcuts, sidebars, and fast switching</li>\n<li>You want better tab organisation than Safari offers</li>\n<li>You liked Arc on Mac and want something closer on iPad</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>❌ <strong>Probably not for you if:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You prefer a simple, no-frills browser</li>\n<li>You don’t use a Magic Keyboard (it still works with touch - it’s just less of a “superpower” workflow)</li>\n<li>You want Chrome extensions on iPad (not possible)</li>\n<li>You mainly browse casually and don’t care about workspace organisation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Beam is intentionally opinionated - it won’t suit everyone, and that’s fine.</p>\n\n<h1>If you want to join the waitlist</h1>\n\n<p>I’m opening up the testing list as I get closer to the private beta.<br/>\nIf you want to try it or give feedback:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://beambrowser.app\"><strong>beambrowser.app</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>Would love feedback, feature ideas, or even scepticism.<br/>\nHappy to answer any questions!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Once I needed to thin the browser footprint a bit (Chrome), due to making a backup of the system and moving to a new disk.<br/>\n{ Though I had no reason, it was a good opportunity to clean things up a bit. I erased about 28 months of history, thousands upon of thousands of entries, other cached bloat, as well as dumb cookies. }</p>\n\n<p>Then I got the idea that all of those history junk and other cached stuff are pointless. Usually when I find something interesting I drop a bookmark based on current YEAR/MONTH. However when I need to &quot;remember&quot; something I visited, my working memory is only about 2 weeks or so, there&#39;s no chance I remember something I visited 2 months ago or even further before.</p>\n\n<p>This is how I got the idea to get an *auto history cleaner* that can delete stuff older than 30 days. Also other times I need to *pause history* and look up things without registering them at all.</p>\n\n<p>As for example I might *pause history* and watch a video about politics or other controversial stuff without ruining my recommendations list and stuff. Or if for example I visit a store to buy something, then I won&#39;t need again the history search times to pop up and bloat my menus. Also less entries, more lightweight the database.  </p>\n\n<p>Addons:<br/>\n• History On/Off<br/>\n• History Cleaner (history-cleaner/epoabannnmjdknejdggkgjoebomipene)</p>\n\n<p>I am about two months now with this and it seems very useful. Later on I might experiment further with auto cleaning cache and cookies. Probably get different addons? Or something else that has all-in-one? I will see.</p>\n\n<p>I just have this recommendation if you like it, give it a thumbs up. Also drop your suggestions as well if you know anything better.  </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have been using Brave for many years without issues, but for the past few weeks whenever I use it to download files from MEGA, MEGA would sometimes pause midway to tell me to free up space. Now if anyone of you are familiar with MEGA, you know that it does not download the file directly and instead, downloads the whole file on a webpage (it writes to the browser&#39;s cache directory) before your choose a location to store that file (move cache to the destination folder). The issue with this way of downloading is that cache sometimes does not get deleted after file downloads, so you would have a massive data folder in brave&#39;s installation directory.</p>\n\n<p>I still have 15G left on my C drive so in theory this shouldn&#39;t be a problem (I always download to drive D and E, never drive C), but since this error keeps popping up, yesterday I decided to move Brave&#39;s entire data folder to drive D, which has more than 1T available. And this is when the nightmare starts.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>According to Google and even Brave themselves, this is where brave&#39;s data folder resides: C:\\Users\\&lt;Username&gt;\\AppData\\Local\\BraveSoftware\\Brave-Browser\\User Data. This folder contains your browsing history, sessions/tabs opened, bookmarks, everything. So all I have to do is to map this to a folder on drive D, right? Well sort of. After some failed attempts I was able to create a symbolic link that connects this folder to a folder on drive D. Once the link is correctly established, everything started working as they should, history is there, tabs are there. If the link isn’t done properly then I lose history, tabs, passwords, etc. basically all user data. That’s how I know the link works. Well, everything works, except when I download from MEGA it still writes to C drive.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>So I pulled up resource monitor to see where all that traffic is going, and when Brave downloads I can see it writing to a folder called data in Brave&#39;s installation directory, in my case C:\\SW\\Brave\\data, this is the location where I installed brave, and brave seems to keep cache here instead of the aforementioned users/appdata folder. But the confusing thing is, the contents in this folder is nearly identical to the aforementioned appdata folder. File and folder names were the same, even folder size were similar. I have never seen a browser keeping 2 identical copies of user data, but oh well. I created another symbolic link that redirects cache to drive D, and this time MEGA is finally writing to Drive D.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>Looking back I really wish I could have stopped here, but I was just too curious. I have never seen a browser keeping 2 identical copies of user data in different locations. I was not using any backup software, nor do I have windows restore point enabled, and that rules out the possibility of windows doing the backup for me. Everything tells me that one of the two folders isn’t being used.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>So, you guessed it, I deleted C:\\SW\\Brave\\data first, thinking it was this folder. Got a brave window with no prior sessions, tabs or history. Must be the other folder I thought, so I restored this folder and deleted the other one, and I was again greeted with the same blank page. I restored both folders, and guess what? Everything came back, the booksmarks, the history, the extensions, all there. Except the tabs. Before I started this whole thing I have 3 windows opened with around 40 tabs, and now they are gone.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>I spent the next 9 hours frantically googling, and came back with the reality that my tabs are really and truly, gone. Like a puff of smoke, never to be retrieved ever again. Brave stores your sessions in &lt;brave install directory&gt;\\data\\Default\\Sessions, in my case, C:\\SW\\Brave\\data\\Default\\Sessions. The unfortunate reality is they only keep 2 sessions. Your current session and your last session. What that means is, in the event of a crash, if you fail to restore the tabs (by clicking the restore last sessions button on the top right) and close Brave, your sessions are gone. Brave will overwrite the session files and no file recovery software will ever be able to retrieve these files ever again, because these files were not deleted, they were overwritten. If you have a hard drive there’s maybe a 0.5% chance that you can retrieve them. If like every laptop these days you have SSD, they are gone. TRIM makes sure everything that isn’t needed is wiped. You can put a person in there and the moment he isn’t needed he would dematerialize.  </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>I have learnt my lesson. I have installed a session manager plugin that saves all my sessions at regular intervals, both locally and on cloud. I have made sure that I will never have another session/tab-related nightmare ever again, and I advise every chromium-based browser user to do the same, get an extension that backs up your tabs locally and on cloud at regular intervals. What happened today ruined my weekend, but it doesn’t have to ruin yours.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>To all the lost windows and tabs, I bid you farewell. You fought brilliantly on the forefront before losing to developer neglect and corporate incompetence. May we cross path again.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p>To developers of chrome and all chromium-based browsers, for years a blue &#39;restore session&#39; button is all there is that separates a tiny island of hope from an unfathomable ocean of despair. The presence of such button inspires awe while the absence of it struck the deepest level of fear and terror. During these years, gigabytes have become terabytes, dialups have given way to fiber. Is it not finally time for you to move on from archiving a meager 2 sessions to the at least 200? Can us users finally not have to worry about losing all our cherished memories to the push of a button?</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: brave browser using 2 folders in separate locations to store identical user data, including history, extensions, sessions, etc. Suspect one is not in use. Tried relocating both folders and was fine. Then tried deleting either of them. Lost all my tabs/sessions but not anything else. Despair. Installed tabs manager to prevent similar disasters. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
