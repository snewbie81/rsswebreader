Back when I was doing MMO stuff, things were way more chill. Now every platform freaks out over the smallest move and flags you instantly.</p>\n\n<p>I even tried logging in with a private proxy the other day and still got thrown straight into a checkpoint. The good old “just switch a proxy and you’re fine” days are pretty much gone.</p>\n\n<p>Technically you don’t have to use an antidetect browser, but it’s getting really close to being a necessity. Platforms aren’t just checking your IP anymore. They look at your whole digital identity and whether everything lines up.</p>\n\n<p>I saw a similar case on the KocerRoxy blog. Stuff that works today might be useless tomorrow. The real challenge is finding a setup where all your tools work together instead of messing each other up.</p>\n\n<p>I’m managing multiple accounts across different platforms, mostly large MMO accounts, and regular browsers just don’t cut it now. Even with proxies, if you don’t isolate fingerprints properly you get flagged pretty fast.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why I started testing antidetect browsers to see if they handle heavy use any better.</p>\n\n<p>I tried AdsPower. The trial only gives you 2 profiles. The price for 100 profiles is 21.6 dollars, which is pretty reasonable. Their virtual browser gives each profile its own hardware parameters, canvas, timezone, fonts and all that. From my testing, reopening the same profile keeps the fingerprint consistent, which matters a lot because fingerprint drift is usually what triggers flags. Some profiles do take a bit longer to open and my local machine stutters here and there, but it is still workable.</p>\n\n<p>I’m curious if anyone here has actually used these tools long term with good results, or if this whole thing is just hype.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

For example, they recently added a hidden empty div over YouTube videos that causes our hardware acceleration fast-path to bail (should now be fixed in Win10 Oct update). Prior to that, our fairly state-of-the-art video acceleration put us well ahead of Chrome on video playback time on battery, but almost the instant they broke things on YouTube, they started advertising Chrome&#39;s dominance over Edge on video-watching battery life. What makes it so sad, is that their claimed dominance was not due to ingenious optimization work by Chrome, but due to a failure of YouTube. On the whole, they only made the web slower.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is from true dev of EdgeHTML, not even stranger, we need a big wiki to collect all the evidences, because people are fast to forget.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I&#39;m starting to think Brave is the more &quot;anti-Google&quot; choice in practice.\nFirefox gets ~80-90% of its revenue from Google (the default search deal). If Google ever pulls the plug, Mozilla has openly admitted that Firefox would be in deep trouble.\nBrave is built on Chromium, yes, but Chromium is open-source (Apache 2.0 license). Brave already heavily forks it: they rip out Google&#39;s code, keep Manifest V2 extension support alive, replace Google services with their own privacy-respecting alternatives, etc. Google can&#39;t force anything on them the way they can pressure Firefox with money.\nSo... isn&#39;t Brave actually less beholden to Google than Firefox is right now?\nAnd on the &quot;Chromium monopoly&quot; argument: an open-source monopoly is still not ideal, but it&#39;s not the same as a proprietary monopoly. Anyone (Brave, Vivaldi, Ungoogled Chromium, even Mozilla if they wanted) can take the code and go their own way without asking Google&#39;s permission.\nChange my mind.
