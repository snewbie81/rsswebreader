Luckily I had an .html file backup (export), which I want to import to my profile and then sync the bookmarks with my Google account. It imports without problems, but there is one problem—bookmarks from folders with the same names are merged into one folder, so the original folder structure is lost. This thing is very important to me, because I had multiple &quot;tree folders&quot; of different topics with subfolders with the same names in them, and now it&#39;s one big mess.</p>\n\n<p>The backup file is not corrupted—when looking at it in the browser, it shows all the folders and subfolders, and also when I imported the .html file into Firefox, the folder structure was like before.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve tried many different methods, such as:</p>\n\n<p>- importing bookmarks to another browser and then transferring data from it to Chrome</p>\n\n<p>- using various extensions; some of them were not working at all*</p>\n\n<p>- using a different (new) profile and a different computer</p>\n\n<p>- using another channel (Chrome Canary)</p>\n\n<p>Yes, probably I could add some unique number to the folders with the same names and preserve the original structure, but it would be very complicated and time-consuming due to the size (tens to hundreds of folders).</p>\n\n<p>* One extension showed promising results—the folder structure was preserved, but there was another problem: when I looked at the source code of the export I made after import with this extension, all bookmarks were added with the same timestamp (the original timestamp when the bookmark was added was lost, so this is also a no-go for me). The extension: <a href=\"http://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bookmark-importexport/gdhpeilfkeeajillmcncaelnppiakjhn\">chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bookmark-importexport/gdhpeilfkeeajillmcncaelnppiakjhn</a></p>\n\n<p>My other idea was to downgrade Chrome (install an older version) when this was working correctly, import bookmarks, update it, and then sync them to the Google account, but I don&#39;t know how to do it.</p>\n\n<p>Do you have any other suggestions or ideas on how to fix this problem? Thanks in advance.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

For example, they recently added a hidden empty div over YouTube videos that causes our hardware acceleration fast-path to bail (should now be fixed in Win10 Oct update). Prior to that, our fairly state-of-the-art video acceleration put us well ahead of Chrome on video playback time on battery, but almost the instant they broke things on YouTube, they started advertising Chrome&#39;s dominance over Edge on video-watching battery life. What makes it so sad, is that their claimed dominance was not due to ingenious optimization work by Chrome, but due to a failure of YouTube. On the whole, they only made the web slower.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is from true dev of EdgeHTML, not even stranger, we need a big wiki to collect all the evidences, because people are fast to forget.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>It honestly feels like the only thing that still works these days is using an antidetect browser. Back when I was doing MMO stuff, things were way more chill. Now every platform freaks out over the smallest move and flags you instantly.</p>\n\n<p>I even tried logging in with a private proxy the other day and still got thrown straight into a checkpoint. The good old “just switch a proxy and you’re fine” days are pretty much gone.</p>\n\n<p>Technically you don’t have to use an antidetect browser, but it’s getting really close to being a necessity. Platforms aren’t just checking your IP anymore. They look at your whole digital identity and whether everything lines up.</p>\n\n<p>I saw a similar case on the KocerRoxy blog. Stuff that works today might be useless tomorrow. The real challenge is finding a setup where all your tools work together instead of messing each other up.</p>\n\n<p>I’m managing multiple accounts across different platforms, mostly large MMO accounts, and regular browsers just don’t cut it now. Even with proxies, if you don’t isolate fingerprints properly you get flagged pretty fast.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why I started testing antidetect browsers to see if they handle heavy use any better.</p>\n\n<p>I tried AdsPower. The trial only gives you 2 profiles. The price for 100 profiles is 21.6 dollars, which is pretty reasonable. Their virtual browser gives each profile its own hardware parameters, canvas, timezone, fonts and all that. From my testing, reopening the same profile keeps the fingerprint consistent, which matters a lot because fingerprint drift is usually what triggers flags. Some profiles do take a bit longer to open and my local machine stutters here and there, but it is still workable.</p>\n\n<p>I’m curious if anyone here has actually used these tools long term with good results, or if this whole thing is just hype.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
