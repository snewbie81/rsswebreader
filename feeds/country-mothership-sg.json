class=\"aligncenter wp-image-872230\" /></a>\r</p><p>The body of a four-year-old girl was found two days after she went missing during the Hat Yai floods in Thailand.\r</p><p>The girl, Amidala “Padme” Arayawat, had fallen into the water on Nov. 25 when the rescue boat ferrying her family capsized in the floodwaters, <a href=\"https://thethaiger.com/news/national/body-of-4-year-old-girl-found-after-rescue-boat-accident-in-hat-yai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Thai</a> <a href=\"https://www.khaosod.co.th/breaking-news/news_10037384\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">media</a> reported.\r</p>\n<p>After her disappearance, the girl's mother sent out a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share/p/19B6zar5MH/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">public appeal</a> on Nov. 27 to find the missing girl.\r</p><p><h2>Went missing after rescue boat capsized</h2>\r</p><p>According to previous posts from the girl's mother, Padme and Padme's brother, along with the mother, were trapped in their home in Banja Road in Hat Yai as the floodwaters rose past the first floor.\r</p><p>She said it would be \"difficult to survive\" if the floods reached the second floor, and added that she was considering swimming over to a neighbour's residence.\r</p><p>She also appealed for assistance to evacuate the building.\r</p><p>However, on Nov. 25 at around 7pm, the rescue boat transporting the family capsized near Bangkok Hospital in Hat Yai due to strong currents.\r</p><p>Padme unfortunately slipped out of her mother's grasp and disappeared into the floodwaters, the appeal said.\r</p><p>She was wearing a blue floral shirt and pink shorts at the time.\r</p><p><h2>Body found</h2>\r</p><p>At about 5pm on Nov. 27, the same day the appeal went out, Padme's mother said in an update that the girl's body had been found.\r</p><p>This led to an outpouring of condolences from online users for the family's loss.\r</p><p>On Dec. 2, Padme's mother shared a tribute <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1X73kotpsh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">post</a> to her deceased daughter, expressing her gratitude for those who reached out.\r</p><p>She also shared her prayer that Padme would be \"a guardian angel\" watching over her family from heaven.\r</p><p><h2>More about the flooding</h2>\r</p><p>Persistent heavy rain led to severe flooding across the Hat Yai district in Thailand’s southern border province of Songkhla starting from Nov. 21.\r</p><p>By the next afternoon, 13 of Songkhla’s 16 districts had been declared disaster zones.\r</p><p>Numerous people ended up stranded in <a href=\"https://mothership.sg/2025/11/people-trapped-hat-yai-hotel-sos-signals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hotels</a> and other buildings due to the floodwaters, including <a href=\"https://mothership.sg/2025/11/hat-yai-flood-singaporeans-stranded/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">at least eight Singaporeans</a>.\r</p><p>Local authorities mobilised the likes of boats, high-clearance trucks and even jet skis to evacuate residents.\r</p><p>As of Dec. 1, Thailand's Public Health Ministry said the <a href=\"https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/3148040/death-toll-claims-stoke-concerns-over-true-scale-of-disaster\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">death toll</a> from the flooding had reached 170, although estimates from the ground have reported a higher number of 500 to 1,000 casualties.\r</p><iframe class='post-embed title='Hat Yai flooding: Body of missing girl, 4,

class=\"aligncenter wp-image-872230\" /></a>China has stepped up its diplomatic offensive against Japan by attempting to rally its former European World War Two allies UK and France to its side.\r</p><p>In talks with British and French officials last week, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi recalled Imperial Japan's aggression during the Second World War, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/02/world/asia/china-japan-taiwan-europe.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare&amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawOcetxleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBzcnRjBmFwcF9pZBAyMjIwMzkxNzg4MjAwODkyAAEeJthgQKjPO0VkqOm4PiSRSXZr1isoPQ14K3z5RZjpiJKASwMlMAsLOj7QgBI_aem_c07lUdZkJx9JyiKHoHEf_A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The New York Times</em></a> reported.\r</p><p>Alluding to the Allied Powers' victory over Imperial Japan, he further urged both countries to rally to China's side once again amidst their ongoing rift with Japan, which began on Nov. 7 when Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi started a \"row\" with Beijing following <a href=\"https://mothership.sg/2025/11/china-warn-citizens-travel-japan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">remarks she made in parliament</a>.\r</p>\n<p><h2>Rift with Japan</h2>\r</p><p>Takaichi said an attack on Taiwan by the Chinese could amount to a \"survival-threatening situation\" and trigger a military response from Tokyo, which Beijing, which maintains that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, has slammed as <a href=\"https://mothership.sg/2025/11/china-sends-letter-to-un-japan-taiwan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\"erroneous\" and \"blatant provocations\"</a>.\r</p><p>This resulted in protests and commercial repercussions from the Chinese, such as advising its citizens not to visit Japan for tourism and imposing a ban on Japanese seafood.\r</p><p>China has also threatened \"further consequences\" on Japan should Takaichi not retract her statement, which she has refused to to date.\r</p><p><h3>Looking for sympathetic onlookers</h3>\r</p><p>In addition, China has attempted to draw other major powers to its side in recent months.\r</p><p><span>On Nov. 21, China's Permanent Representative to the UN Fu Cong sent a letter to the United Nations (UN) secretary-general António Guterres accusing Takaichi of violating international law by challenging China's national interests.</span>\r</p><p><span>He further warned that his country will exercise their right to self-defend if Japan attempted to intervene militarily in Taiwan.</span>\r</p><p>In a Nov. 24 call with U.S. President Donald Trump, China's president Xi Jinping also asserted his country's claim to Taiwan, telling his American counterpart that <span>the island's return to China is an \"integral part of the postwar international order\".</span>\r</p><p>Xi has not ruled out the use of force with regards to the self-governing island.\r</p><p><span>Citing China and the U.S.'s alliance in fighting fascism and militarism in the Second World War, he again urged the U.S. to join them in jointly safeguarding the victorious outcome of the war.</span>\r</p><p><h2>Europe's stances</h2>\r</p><p>In a meeting with UK's foreign security adviser Jonathan Powell in Beijing on Nov. 27, and over a phone call with France's <span>presidential foreign policy adviser Emmanuel Bonne on Nov. 28, Wang called on both countries to abide by China's one-China policy and \"safeguard the outcomes\" of World War Two, <em>NYT</em> reported.</span>\r</p><p>\"<span>Provocative remarks on Taiwan by the incumbent Japanese leader are blatantly turning back the wheel of history and infringe on China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" Wang reportedly said.</span>\r</p><p>To date, both Britain and France do not officially recognise Taiwan as a country, but support the status quo in the Taiwan Strait and oppose the use of force by China to claim Taiwan, or threaten to do so.\r</p><p>However, China's other European ally Russia appears to agree with the country's stance.\r</p><p>Wang also held a meeting with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov in Beijing on Dec. 2, where both leaders jointly called for the safeguarding of World War Two outcomes, Chinese state media <a href=\"https://english.news.cn/20251203/909c329631bf4949a18671063b07a379/c.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Xinhua</em></a> reported.\r</p><p>Both countries should cooperate in resisting Japan's \"far right\" forces, Wang said.\r</p><p>Lavrov also reaffirmed Russia' commitment to China's one-China principle, supporting China's stance on their claim to Taiwan.\r</p><p><h2>Related stories:</h2>\r</p><iframe class='post-embed title='China evokes spectre of WWII-era Japan, calls on UK, France to take its side in
