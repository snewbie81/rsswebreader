That's not good enough,\" he said.\r</p><p>Hazman said the man's lips were already \"turning blue\" at that point, and medical staff subsequently had to put him on oxygen.\r</p><p>Hazman urged organisers to improve on the medical response and \"do better\" for the full marathon on Dec. 7.\r</p><p><h2>Organisers' response</h2>\r</p><p>A spokesperson for Ironman, the event organiser, said there was a fully staffed medical command centre at the event with \"robust medical protocols in place, developed in consultation with healthcare professionals and submitted to the relevant authorities\".\r</p><p>“The safety and well-being of all participants at the Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon (SCSM) is our top priority,\" said the spokesperson.\r</p><p>In addition to the command centre, multiple medical posts and tents were deployed along the route, and at the start and finish venues, supported by trained doctors, nurses, and emergency responders.\r</p><p>The spokesperson also said communication systems were in place to coordinate between medical stations and the command centre.\r</p><p>\"Medical scenarios were also played out during a tabletop exercise to ensure there was alignment with command centre, medical providers and staffs,\" the spokesperson added.\r</p><p><h2>What was done when the runner collapsed?</h2>\r</p><p>Regarding the runner who collapsed, the spokesperson said that after the command centre received the alert, it provided support, monitored the situation, and also followed through with the hospital providing care for the patient.\r</p><p>The spokesperson said: \"Our team worked within the planned protocols to ensure the participant’s safety was looked after. The participant is well and recovering.\"\r</p><p>The spokesperson also addressed allegations about poor medical access at the event, saying: \"To ensure medical access in areas like Gardens by the Bay East, our medical plan included deploying medical buggies and bikes to reach runners quickly in these areas. As an added step, the park connector at Gardens by the Bay East was also closed to public to reduce congestion for participants.\"\r</p><p>\"Feedback from participants and medical professionals is invaluable, and we remain committed to reviewing our processes to uphold the highest standards of safety and care,” the spokesperson concluded.\r</p><p><em>Top image from Mothership reader &amp; user59674196868313/TikTok</em></p></p>",

This wasn’t about overstaying or breaking rules — our stays have always been legal. I’m sharing this because people travelling soon should know that immigration decisions can sometimes be unclear and strict, even when you think you’ve done everything right. Requirements to guarantee your best chance at entering Thailand again: - 20k baht in cash - Digital arrival card - Accommodation booked in Thailand - Proof of onward travel To avoid the same mistake I made, these requirements are always subject to change and all travellers should check them on the official government website before booking your trip. https://www.thaigov.go.th/en ❤️🇹🇭 <a title=\"creatorsearchinsights\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/creatorsearchinsights?refer=embed\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#creatorsearchinsights</a> <a title=\"thailand\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/thailand?refer=embed\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#thailand</a> <a title=\"immigration\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/immigration?refer=embed\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#immigration</a> <a title=\"explorer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/explorer?refer=embed\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#explorer</a> <a title=\"foryoupagе\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryoupag%D0%B5?refer=embed\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#foryoupagе</a> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - Kaya | Third Culture Kid 🌍\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7580618629100718851?refer=embed\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">♬ original sound - Kaya | Third Culture Kid 🌍</a></section></p></blockquote>\r</p><p><script async src=\"https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js\"></script>\r</p><p><span>Thailand’s official entry rules state that foreign tourists must provide evidence of sufficient financial means when entering the country.</span>\r</p><p><span>According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.thaiembassy.com/travel-to-thailand/thailand-entry-requirements\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Thai Embassy</a><span>, applicants for a tourist visa and travellers entering Thailand under the visa exemption rule must show proof of finances of at least 20,000 baht (S$814.95) per person upon request.  </span>\r</p><p>Other required documents include proof of onward travel, such as a paid airline ticket, and accommodation details.\r</p><p><span>If deemed necessary, consular officers may request additional documentation. </span>\r</p><p><em>Top photo from KaoticKaya/TikTok.</em></p></p>",
