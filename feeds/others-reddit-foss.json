Almost every software I used tl this day had at least one &quot;UX flaw&quot; that certainly drives people away from it. Shouldn&#39;t we put a little more focus on this kind of thing? \nA recent example that happened to me: I listen to podcasts A LOT, and I&#39;ve been using a proprietary app on mobile but I want to go 100% FOSS, so I found alternatives. The one that&#39;s best rated is really good, nice looking, well build, but it doesn&#39;s stream entire shows without manually adding to queue. This is a small thing that is &quot;bothering&quot; me, and I&#39;m quite resilient about tech, but imagine how non tech savvy people would deal with this kind of thing.\nI know there&#39;s a huge problem with investment to mantain foss but is there a solution to this? How to make it more acessible to UX people to contribute? People who are outside the tech field?\nI would like to hear opinions about this cause I&#39;m really curious!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

We decided to built FloAI after having to sent a lot of time optimising and analysing langchain based agents. FloAI is designed with simplicity and customisability in mind. We used the YAML-based agent building to make it easily configurable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where we are now ?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>Once FloAI was kind of solving most of our problems, the focus changed to giving access to the right data and streams. The problem at high level was about building workflows which could be used to automate many tasks. Thats when we started building infrastructure. This infrastructure has now evolved in Wavefront AI.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Whats special about Wavefront ?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>- Easy to configure agents and workflows, fully YAML-Based  </p>\n\n<p>- No Vendor lock-in, bring any LLM, STT or TTS models. Direct support for open source frameworks like vLLM &amp; Ollama  </p>\n\n<p>- Built in capabilities to connect  to different data sources and api services directly from AI using agentic tools</p>\n\n<p>- Comes with voice agents out of the box, and ready to deploy. And this can now connect any of the agents you have built.</p>\n\n<p>- Built in integration with Open Telemetry, just connect jaguers or graphana to get 100 % obeservaility</p>\n\n<p>- Built in eval for agents built on Wavefront.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why are we posting here ?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We are open sourcing this as a platform in December 2025.</strong><br/>\nAs we work on getting the code ready we are looking for:  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> Some early feedback based on README that we have uploaded, on the architecture and more.<br/></li>\n<li>Some early adopters who would like to take it for spin<br/></li>\n<li>Ofcourse, your support by starring our repo</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Please find Wavefront @ <a href=\"https://github.com/rootflo/wavefront\">https://github.com/rootflo/wavefront</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

No locked features, no required accounts, no telemetry.</p>\n\n<p>The project started because many smaller community programs don’t have the budget or infrastructure for the big commercial solutions, but still need something safe, simple, and reliable.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to take a look, the demo, docs, and source are at:\n<a href=\"https://youthcheckin.net\">https://youthcheckin.net</a></p>\n\n<p>I’m especially looking for feedback from folks who self-host, people who work in community/education spaces, and anyone who likes poking at small FOSS tools. Bugs, critiques, feature ideas. Anything helps.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for taking the time to check it out. If it ends up helping someone else, that’s a win.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

In addition, it is now possible to drag instances, as well as check the point at which they are released by visitors, in a collision check. To learn more about these features, we&#39;ve created a video tutorial showing the process of creating a photo gallery to be distributed on tablets.: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/o-fAWoBMe_M\">https://youtu.be/o-fAWoBMe_M</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/preview/pre/fytg3fxoff3g1.jpg?width=3413&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec7e6c21ab020cc02b2d55cd0863bdd47c6b02ea\">/preview/pre/fytg3fxoff3g1.jpg?width=3413&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec7e6c21ab020cc02b2d55cd0863bdd47c6b02ea</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Array manipulation</strong><br/>\nThe new array manipulation feature allows for more comprehensive data management in your creations, enabling the development of more complex products.

This feature also works between different workspaces open in the same movie.</li>\n<li>Multiple selection: by holding down the ctrl (or command) key, it is now possible to select multiple instances at once by clicking at their name on the list.</li>\n<li>Instance arrangement: with multiple selection, traditional features such as relative alignment, space distribution, and repositioning are now available.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"/preview/pre/a4ype6wqff3g1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e326045cd53f1e89458e77b0b2ae0c1b62147d78\">/preview/pre/a4ype6wqff3g1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e326045cd53f1e89458e77b0b2ae0c1b62147d78</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
