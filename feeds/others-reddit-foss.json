But when these files grow beyond a few megabytes, they become nearly impossible to work with using standard tools like <strong>VS Code</strong>, <strong>Sublime Text</strong>, or even dedicated JSON viewers. </p><p>The editor freezes. Your laptop fans sound like a jet engine. And eventually, you’re forced to close the app, losing any progress or context.</p><p>This isn’t just annoying, it’s a real workflow blocker.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-bookmark-card\"><a class=\"kg-bookmark-container\" href=\"https://medevel.com/reading-large-files-text-csv-178/\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-content\"><div class=\"kg-bookmark-title\">17 Free Solutions to Open and Manage Large Text, CSV and Excel Files</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-description\">Reading large text files is essential for various use cases in data processing and analysis. Here are some reasons why reading large text files is needed: 1. Big Data Analysis: With the increasing volume of data being generated, organizations often need to analyze large text files to extract valuable insights.</div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-metadata\"><img class=\"kg-bookmark-icon\" src=\"https://medevel.com/content/images/icon/artificial-intelligence--1--1-1336.png\" alt=\"\"><span class=\"kg-bookmark-author\">MEDevel.com | Open-source Apps for Healthcare and Enterprise</span><span class=\"kg-bookmark-publisher\">Hazem Abbas</span></div></div><div class=\"kg-bookmark-thumbnail\"><img src=\"https://medevel.com/content/images/thumbnail/screenshot--7--1.png\" alt=\"\" onerror=\"this.style.display = 'none'\"></div></a></figure><p>Developers need to <strong>inspect, search, and analyze</strong> large JSON files regularly:</p><ul><li>Debugging API responses from <strong>microservices</strong></li><li>Reviewing exported database dumps</li><li>Validating data pipelines or <strong>ETL outputs</strong></li><li>Working with machine learning datasets or telemetry logs</li></ul><p>But most tools treat JSON as plain text. They try to load the entire file into memory, syntax-highlight it all at once, and build a full parse tree, which is overkill and unsustainable for large files.</p><p>That’s where <strong>Janice</strong> comes in.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-janice-the-json-file-viewer\">What is Janice, The JSON File Viewer?</h2><p>Janice is a lightweight desktop app designed specifically for <strong>viewing and navigating massive JSON files quickly and efficiently,</strong> without crashing, freezing, or consuming all your RAM.</p><p>Instead of loading everything at once, Janice uses smart streaming and lazy-loading techniques to parse only the parts you’re interacting with. It presents the data in a clean, expandable tree structure, supports fast search, syntax validation, and even lets you extract specific paths or arrays, all while keeping memory usage low.</p><p>The app is developed by <strong>Erik Kalkoken</strong>, a Programmer, gamer and Eve Online addict.</p><p>For developers, data engineers, &amp; data scientists, this means:<br></p><ul><li>No more “Out of Memory” errors</li><li><strong>Instant preview of large files</strong> (even 10GB+)</li><li>Fast search across deeply nested fields</li><li>Ability to explore data without writing custom scripts</li><li>Focus on <em>understanding the data</em>, not fighting the tool</li></ul><p>In a world where data keeps growing, having a reliable, performant way to inspect JSON is no longer a luxury, it’s essential.</p><p>Janice isn’t just another JSON viewer.<br>It’s a developer’s flashlight in the dark, tangled forest of big data.</p><h3 id=\"features\">Features</h3><ul><li>Cross-platform</li><li>Browse through a JSON document in classic tree structure</li><li>JSON files can be opened via file dialog, from clipboard, dropped on the window or given as command line argument</li><li>Supports viewing very large <strong>JSON</strong> <strong>files</strong> (&gt;100MB, &gt;10M elements)</li><li>Search for keys and values in the document. Supports wildcards.</li><li>Export parts of a JSON file into a new file or to clipboard</li><li>Copy values to clipboard</li><li>Single executable file, no installation required</li><li>Desktop app that runs on Windows, Linux and macOS</li><li>Automatic dark and light theme</li></ul><h2 id=\"platforms\">Platforms</h2><ul><li>Windows</li><li>Linux</li><li>macOS</li></ul><h2 id=\"install-and-run\">Install and Run</h2><p>To run Janice just download and unzip the latest release to your computer.

I strongly agree with the principal of open source and have even donated to a couple OS projecs. In all honesty I know exactly how I want to release this software (btw, it&#39;s a Digital Asset Manager for songs in the ChordPro format which converts to chord over lyric, formats in a fun way, has some editors for both formats, metadata tracking and tagging, a chord generator so hovering over a chord shows a tooltip for the chord, tracks performances, etc. think if Ultimate Guitar and digikam had a baby), but I&#39;m anxious about releasing it at all.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s something i want to share because it brings me a ton of value, and I think especially if I collaborated with some other musicians it could really end up being a really nifty tool for some people, but also, my coding skills kinda suck so I relied pretty heavily on vibe coding  for a lot of it. I went off on several different tangents as I developed the vision, searched random pathways for solutions to stupid issues I was having, my code consistency is terrible because, well, vibe coding...</p>\n\n<p>So, while I do feel proud of the work I did put into it, and I&#39;m genuinely happy with the product I&#39;ve been able to kludge together (for myself), I also feel deeply self conscious of the quality of &quot;my code&quot;, and I almost don&#39;t want anyone looking under the hood to see what a mess it is.</p>\n\n<p>I realize at the end of the day I&#39;m just some dude who had a neat idea and put in hundreds of hours of his life using the tools available to him to make something come out if it rather than just watching TV or something, and that&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of, but idk.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe I&#39;m just looking for some inner clarity here.

I have a corporate programming job, but I&#39;m at the brink of burning out due to the environment.  It&#39;s been more than a decade since I was able to do any programming I found interesting (my job so far has mostly consisted on dealing with non-essential complexity in huge, messy, over complicated, legacy codebases that someone else wrote).  So I need to &quot;touch grass&quot;, to do some intellectually interesting programming.  I&#39;m looking for suggestions of FOSS projects to contribute to that I could learn from and for which my skill set could be of use:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Very analytical, skilled, well-rounded programmer (from systems-level, to scripting and Python REST APIs).</li>\n<li>~15y experience doing systems-level programming and troubleshooting (mostly Linux and C/asm).</li>\n<li>Data-oriented, performance-oriented programming (&quot;computer-aware&quot; programming).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The ideal would be systems-level, Linux/Unix, C-lang project(s) with actual use in the industry (to feel I&#39;m doing &quot;meaningful work&quot;) but I&#39;m equally open for other interesting and/or funny projects.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions are welcome.

The company also was charged with fines vor using cracked software by the original vendor.</p>\n\n<p>I did introduce software like Handbrake, ShareX, inkscape and other useful software. Even using checkmk for server and network monitoring and FreeCAD found a use case too.</p>\n\n<p>I told the other IT guy (he is the boss of IT department) we could set up a yearly donation budget to donate to various FOSS software every year.</p>\n\n<p>The answer was &quot;no, why should we pay if we do not have to?&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>It is so sad that a lot of people are FOSS vampires, and if companies make heavy use of foss and give nothing back I do get angry.</p>\n\n<p>I will stop finding FOSS software at my workplace. Let them pay, they don&#39;t deserve FOSS.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: thank you for all your kind answers! You are awesome!</p>\n\n<p>I can create bug reports, manuals and so during my working hours.
