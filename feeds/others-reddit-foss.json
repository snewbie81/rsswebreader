I&#39;d appreciate suggestions too!</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you&#39;ll be a part of the FOSS community.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

So please give me your feedback and ideas, and i will help make it true.

I strongly agree with the principal of open source and have even donated to a couple OS projecs. In all honesty I know exactly how I want to release this software (btw, it&#39;s a Digital Asset Manager for songs in the ChordPro format which converts to chord over lyric, formats in a fun way, has some editors for both formats, metadata tracking and tagging, a chord generator so hovering over a chord shows a tooltip for the chord, tracks performances, etc. think if Ultimate Guitar and digikam had a baby), but I&#39;m anxious about releasing it at all.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s something i want to share because it brings me a ton of value, and I think especially if I collaborated with some other musicians it could really end up being a really nifty tool for some people, but also, my coding skills kinda suck so I relied pretty heavily on vibe coding  for a lot of it. I went off on several different tangents as I developed the vision, searched random pathways for solutions to stupid issues I was having, my code consistency is terrible because, well, vibe coding...</p>\n\n<p>So, while I do feel proud of the work I did put into it, and I&#39;m genuinely happy with the product I&#39;ve been able to kludge together (for myself), I also feel deeply self conscious of the quality of &quot;my code&quot;, and I almost don&#39;t want anyone looking under the hood to see what a mess it is.</p>\n\n<p>I realize at the end of the day I&#39;m just some dude who had a neat idea and put in hundreds of hours of his life using the tools available to him to make something come out if it rather than just watching TV or something, and that&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of, but idk.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe I&#39;m just looking for some inner clarity here.

The version I downloaded is from F-Droid, called Forkgram, because I needed it for downloading. When I opened it, it asked me to sign up for a Telegram fee and requested my credit card information including my CVV, credit card number, expiry date, name, state, postal code, etc. I was like what the hell. I thought Telegram was supposed to be private and here it is asking me for all this stuff.</p>\n\n<p>I’d like to know if this has happened to any of you. Did you go through with it or is this most likely a scam? Did I download a fake Telegram app? This one is from Forkgram, by the way, not the official Telegram app. I downloaded it from F-Droid and I have a feeling I downloaded the wrong thing or the developers of this fork might be doing phishing. I’m not sure.</p>\n\n<p>I tried signing up on the official Telegram app and it doesn’t ask for anything like this.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I have a corporate programming job, but I&#39;m at the brink of burning out due to the environment.  It&#39;s been more than a decade since I was able to do any programming I found interesting (my job so far has mostly consisted on dealing with non-essential complexity in huge, messy, over complicated, legacy codebases that someone else wrote).  So I need to &quot;touch grass&quot;, to do some intellectually interesting programming.  I&#39;m looking for suggestions of FOSS projects to contribute to that I could learn from and for which my skill set could be of use:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Very analytical, skilled, well-rounded programmer (from systems-level, to scripting and Python REST APIs).</li>\n<li>~15y experience doing systems-level programming and troubleshooting (mostly Linux and C/asm).</li>\n<li>Data-oriented, performance-oriented programming (&quot;computer-aware&quot; programming).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The ideal would be systems-level, Linux/Unix, C-lang project(s) with actual use in the industry (to feel I&#39;m doing &quot;meaningful work&quot;) but I&#39;m equally open for other interesting and/or funny projects.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions are welcome.

The company also was charged with fines vor using cracked software by the original vendor.</p>\n\n<p>I did introduce software like Handbrake, ShareX, inkscape and other useful software. Even using checkmk for server and network monitoring and FreeCAD found a use case too.</p>\n\n<p>I told the other IT guy (he is the boss of IT department) we could set up a yearly donation budget to donate to various FOSS software every year.</p>\n\n<p>The answer was &quot;no, why should we pay if we do not have to?&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>It is so sad that a lot of people are FOSS vampires, and if companies make heavy use of foss and give nothing back I do get angry.</p>\n\n<p>I will stop finding FOSS software at my workplace. Let them pay, they don&#39;t deserve FOSS.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: thank you for all your kind answers! You are awesome!</p>\n\n<p>I can create bug reports, manuals and so during my working hours.
