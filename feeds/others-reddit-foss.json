      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>recently I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about UX in FOSS as I&#39;m back at uni studying IT.\nI came back because I want to learn and make my own things, in a world where everything proprietary is enshitified more and more everyday. \nI want to contribute to FOSS cause I think it&#39;s the right way to use technologies, and I believe every FOSS person wants to see it spreading more and more.\nBut then I got to the UX problem. Almost every software I used tl this day had at least one &quot;UX flaw&quot; that certainly drives people away from it. Shouldn&#39;t we put a little more focus on this kind of thing? \nA recent example that happened to me: I listen to podcasts A LOT, and I&#39;ve been using a proprietary app on mobile but I want to go 100% FOSS, so I found alternatives. The one that&#39;s best rated is really good, nice looking, well build, but it doesn&#39;s stream entire shows without manually adding to queue. This is a small thing that is &quot;bothering&quot; me, and I&#39;m quite resilient about tech, but imagine how non tech savvy people would deal with this kind of thing.\nI know there&#39;s a huge problem with investment to mantain foss but is there a solution to this? How to make it more acessible to UX people to contribute? People who are outside the tech field?\nI would like to hear opinions about this cause I&#39;m really curious!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

We decided to built FloAI after having to sent a lot of time optimising and analysing langchain based agents. FloAI is designed with simplicity and customisability in mind. We used the YAML-based agent building to make it easily configurable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Where we are now ?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>Once FloAI was kind of solving most of our problems, the focus changed to giving access to the right data and streams. The problem at high level was about building workflows which could be used to automate many tasks. Thats when we started building infrastructure. This infrastructure has now evolved in Wavefront AI.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Whats special about Wavefront ?</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>- Easy to configure agents and workflows, fully YAML-Based  </p>\n\n<p>- No Vendor lock-in, bring any LLM, STT or TTS models. Direct support for open source frameworks like vLLM &amp; Ollama  </p>\n\n<p>- Built in capabilities to connect  to different data sources and api services directly from AI using agentic tools</p>\n\n<p>- Comes with voice agents out of the box, and ready to deploy. And this can now connect any of the agents you have built.</p>\n\n<p>- Built in integration with Open Telemetry, just connect jaguers or graphana to get 100 % obeservaility</p>\n\n<p>- Built in eval for agents built on Wavefront.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why are we posting here ?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We are open sourcing this as a platform in December 2025.</strong><br/>\nAs we work on getting the code ready we are looking for:  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> Some early feedback based on README that we have uploaded, on the architecture and more.<br/></li>\n<li>Some early adopters who would like to take it for spin<br/></li>\n<li>Ofcourse, your support by starring our repo</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Please find Wavefront @ <a href=\"https://github.com/rootflo/wavefront\">https://github.com/rootflo/wavefront</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I work in SEO and was shocked that the industry normalizes paying $250-1000+/year for what&#39;s essentially HTTP requests + HTML parsing. Screaming Frog charges $259/year for a desktop app that doesn&#39;t even use their servers. The free version caps at 500 URLs to force upgrades.<br/>\nSo I built LibreCrawl:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>MIT licensed, fully FOSS</li>\n<li>Self-hosted web interface (multi-tenant)</li>\n<li>Plugin system - drop .js files in a folder to add custom analysis tabs</li>\n<li>JavaScript rendering via Playwright</li>\n<li>No URL limits, no subscriptions, no phone-home</li>\n<li>Handles 1M+ URLs with real-time memory profiling</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Just shipped a complete plugin API that lets anyone build custom SEO analyzers without touching backend code. Ships with a working E-E-A-T analyzer as an example.</p>\n\n<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/PhialsBasement/LibreCrawl\">https://github.com/PhialsBasement/LibreCrawl</a></p>\n\n<p>Demo: <a href=\"https://librecrawl.com/app/\">https://librecrawl.com/app/</a> (3 free crawls - account creation and plugins is disabled due to some server limitations, to get the full experience pls self host, its very easy)</p>\n\n<p>Plugin Workshop: <a href=\"https://librecrawl.com/workshop/\">https://librecrawl.com/workshop/</a></p>\n\n<p>The goal isn&#39;t to compete with Screaming Frog, it&#39;s to eliminate the entire rent-seeking model in SEO tools. So please give me your feedback and ideas, and i will help make it true. If you want to make plugins, publish them in github discussions</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/preview/pre/e4vs515eqc2g1.png?width=1888&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b88576d63a981680b1b31646d8e7bcaf40ba3c5\">/preview/pre/e4vs515eqc2g1.png?width=1888&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b88576d63a981680b1b31646d8e7bcaf40ba3c5</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/preview/pre/e7os91sgqc2g1.png?width=1885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93aede8a15e8b7b18915e5050d98b58645e50640\">/preview/pre/e7os91sgqc2g1.png?width=1885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93aede8a15e8b7b18915e5050d98b58645e50640</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
