When I logged back in, they didn&#39;t come back. Any help?</p>\n\n<p>|| || ||</p>\n\n<p>Yesterday I opened my laptop, opened Edge, all my favorites (bookmarked websites) were there, I assume my browsing history was there too.</p>\n\n<p>Before I started doing anything, the account icon in the top right corner immediately caught my eye.</p>\n\n<p>It was highlighted in red, or yellow, I don&#39;t remember (using Dark Mode if that matters), and if I&#39;m remembering correctly, it was a login error and it was asking me to login manually into my Microsoft account.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know why it happened. It was showing the picture of my account, not a blank general account icon, so it was still somehow connected to Edge, it just had an issue.</p>\n\n<p>Now here&#39;s the thing. I generally don&#39;t like to log in with my account into Microsoft products I use. I prefer to use them while being &quot;off grid&quot; as much as possible. So if you asked me before yesterday&#39;s incident &quot;Are you logged in with your account in Edge?&quot; I would&#39;ve told you &quot;No&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Given that principle, I assumed that I was never logged in, and Microsoft was just trying to rear its head into my user experience, so instead of re-logging in as it was asking me to do, I chose to remove the account completely.</p>\n\n<p>It warned me that I would be losing my browsing data, but I assumed that was just procedural warning they&#39;re obligated to give me regardless of my situation.</p>\n\n<p>I thought my browsing data was safely and locally stored on my device, independent of my account, and when I was gonna remove the account, I would still retain them on my machine.</p>\n\n<p>I was wrong. The moment I logged out, Edge restarted and everything was gone.</p>\n\n<p>I thought &quot;Well okay, maybe I was wrong, maybe I was logged in all this time and I just forgot about it. Let me log in again and restore my data&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>If it matters, I tried to log in yesterday and I kept getting &quot;You&#39;ve tried to sign in too many times with an incorrect account or password... Help us make sure you&#39;re not a robot.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>My credentials were correct, so I waited 24 hours before trying to log in again given the advice I found online when I googled the issue.</p>\n\n<p>And here I am after trying again 24 hours later. I was able to log in successfully.</p>\n\n<p>My old browsing history didn&#39;t return, and the favorites list that I got back was severely not up to date.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m guessing this has something to do with syncing, perhaps I had it turned off. But if it wasn&#39;t syncing my new favorited websites, why did it also remove them when I removed the account?</p>\n\n<p>Is there any chance that they are still locally stored on my laptop? Is there a chance that a system restore could undo the issue? Is there any other solution?</p>\n\n<p>Please let me know, I really need those favorited websites back.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I&#39;m experiencing a persistent issue where videos served from <a href=\"http://packaged-media.redd.it\"><code>packaged-media.redd.it</code></a> load very slowly and buffer every couple of seconds during playback.</p>\n\n<p>This only happens in Edge. When I use Firefox or Chrome, they resolve <a href=\"http://packaged-media.redd.it\"><code>packaged-media.redd.it</code></a> to the same IP address and load the same videos, whether via direct links or from the original Reddit posts, without any problems: no slowdowns, buffering or stuttering. Other video and streaming services, such as YouTube, Netflix, and Twitch, work flawlessly in Edge.</p>\n\n<p>Efficiency mode is disabled, hardware acceleration is enabled, and the only extensions I have active in Edge are Bitwarden and AdGuard. Their configurations are identical to those in Firefox and Chrome. What could be causing this issue with loading media from <a href=\"http://packaged-media.redd.it\"><code>packaged-media.redd.it</code></a> specifically in Edge?</p>\n\n<p>Here are the troubleshooting steps I&#39;ve already tried, none of which helped:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Disabling all extensions</li>\n<li>Turning off hardware acceleration</li>\n<li>Resetting Edge settings to default</li>\n<li>Restarting my router, modem and PC</li>\n<li>Trying different DNS resolvers</li>\n<li>Changing the user agent to Chrome or Firefox</li>\n<li>Disabling Enhance Videos option</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
