When I use Firefox or Chrome, they resolve <a href=\"http://packaged-media.redd.it\"><code>packaged-media.redd.it</code></a> to the same IP address and load the same videos, whether via direct links or from the original Reddit posts, without any problems: no slowdowns, buffering or stuttering.

Your feedback really helps.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve never heard of the extension before: Home Sweet Home is a small project I started recently, and it lets you customize your new tab page with widgets, your favorite links, custom icons, bookmarks, and even Home Assistant controls. It’s still modest in scale (about 45 users), but I’m doing my best to make it better update after update.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the links if you want to try it or update:</p>\n\n<p>Chrome: <a href=\"https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/home-sweet-home/hliapbikacikepiaojmphlhndgjmlodh\">https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/home-sweet-home/hliapbikacikepiaojmphlhndgjmlodh</a></p>\n\n<p>Edge: <a href=\"https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/home-sweet-home/dllgnjnckigifjgfiijdahnoohclacko\">https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/home-sweet-home/dllgnjnckigifjgfiijdahnoohclacko</a></p>\n\n<p>Firefox: <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/home-sweet-home/\">https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/home-sweet-home/</a></p>\n\n<p>If you have suggestions, ideas for new widgets, or anything else, I’d love to hear it.
