But physical activity may slow that steady downward march.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an observational study of people at risk for Alzheimer’s, researchers linked <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03955-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">walking between 3,000 and 5,000 steps per day to a three-year delay in cognitive decline</a>, compared with sedentary individuals. For people who walked between 5,000 and 7,500 steps per day, the reprieve appeared to last even longer — seven years, Harvard Medical School behavioral neurologist Jasmeer Chhatwal and his colleagues report November 3 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The association still needs to be tested in a clinical trial, Chhatwal says, but his team’s results hint at something important. Quality of life for people with Alzheimer’s and their families often plummets in the later stages of the disease. “If the disease can be delayed,” he says, “that can have a very big impact on people’s lives.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous studies have reported links between physical activity and delayed Alzheimer’s progression, says Deborah Barnes, an epidemiologist who studies dementia at the University of California, San Francisco, and who was not part of the research team. But the new study pinpoints the step count where people begin to see benefits. It also “helps to explain <em>how</em>,” she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chhatwal’s team reported a connection between exercise and less accumulation of certain Alzheimer’s proteins in the brain. It’s a mechanism that illustrates how physical activity probably works to slow Alzheimer’s progression, Barnes says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alzheimer’s disease is the <a href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia/frequently-asked-questions-about-alzheimers-disease\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most common form of dementia</a>. In the United States, dementia affects more than 6 million people, and case counts are rising. As the population of older people grows, scientists predict that <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dementia-baby-boomers-increase-2060\">1 million adults per year</a> will develop the condition by 2060, reaching a total of nearly 14 million cases. There’s currently no cure. “But there may be things that [people] can do to delay or prevent the onset of symptoms,” Chhatwal says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His team analyzed data from nearly 300 people, ages 50 to 90, who had no cognitive issues at the start of the study. Researchers tallied the participants’ daily step counts for a week, tested their cognitive abilities and scanned their brains to look a protein called amyloid beta, which can be an early indicator of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People who have this indicator may feel a sense of inevitability that they’re going to decline over time, says Chhatwal. “But the reality,” he says, “is that a lot of people actually do pretty well.” He wanted to figure out what distinguishes people who fare well from those who don’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chhatwal’s team followed the study participants over nine years, on average, performing cognitive tests annually. The researchers also repeated the brain scans multiple times over the study period to track both <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/protein-brain-diseases-blood-parkinsons\">amyloid beta and another protein called tau</a>. Tau forms tangles in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s and builds up after amyloid beta accumulates. It’s a sign of disease progression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People at risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease ­based on their initial brain scans had less tau buildup over time if they were at least somewhat active, the team found. That’s compared with people who walked less than 3,000 steps per day. And less tau buildup generally meant more cognitive function. Minimally active people, those who logged 3,000 to 5,000 daily steps, saw 40 percent less cognitive decline than sedentary individuals, the researchers observed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The most important takeaway is that you start to see the benefits of exercise with as little as 3,000 steps a day,” Barnes says. That’s about 30 minutes of daily walking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chhatwal hopes that people with a high genetic risk for Alzheimer’s feel empowered by the results. Physical activity may be one thing they can do to delay symptoms, he says. And, as scientists have shown with other health conditions, <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physical-activity-exercise-health-benefits\">people can see gains with very little pain</a>. “What I tell my own patients,” he says, “is that every little bit counts.”</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t</div> <!-- /.rich-text -->\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\n\n<section class=\"more-on-topic__wrapper___NVO9k\">\n\t<h2 id=\"carousel-heading\" class=\"more-on-topic__heading___oSdNk\">\n\t\tMore Stories from Science News on <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/topic/health-medicine\">Health &amp;

Rubin Observatory</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/communities-avoid-destruction-wildfires\">how science-based strategies can protect communities from wildfires</a>. But the most consequential news of the year has been the assault on science by the Trump administration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We started alerting readers to potential impacts of Trump’s second term on science immediately after the election, and have reported extensively on actions to overhaul the nation’s science priorities and impose major funding cuts, including on fields such as astronomy and health that have historically enjoyed strong bipartisan support.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We also went deep on the science behind hot button topics that surfaced, including the <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/biological-sex-male-female-intersex\">complexity of biological sex beyond male and female</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antidepressants-ssris-depression-mental\">safety of antidepressants</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fluoride-drinking-water-dental-health\">health effects of removing fluoride from drinking water</a>; and the <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/autism-rates-rose-experts-explain-why\">reasons for rising rates of autism</a>, as well as the support that people with autism and their families say they need to thrive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this issue, we provide perspective on this consequential year by <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-america-trump-administration\">zeroing in on four areas of science</a>, asking researchers how their work has been impacted, what they’re doing to carry on and how they envision where their fields are headed next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also analyzed data from more than 5,300 National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation grants terminated or frozen by the Trump administration in 2025 and <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nih-nsf-cuts-2025-data\">captured that analysis in a data visualization</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Associate news editor Christopher Crockett, who is also our resident data expert, collaborated with assistant art director Brody Price to create a sunburst graphic that conveys a large amount of information in two pages. Freelance data journalist Cam Rodriguez did a second analysis of the data, using different tools and a different programming language, to confirm the accuracy of our analysis. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to end the year with a ray of hope, we introduce the five researchers we’re honoring as our <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-to-watch-career-researchers\">2025 Scientists to Watch</a>. Each of these remarkable young researchers is clear-eyed about the challenges they face, and each is exhilarated by seeking answers to the big questions that their research poses. They are the future of science.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t</div> <!-- /.rich-text -->\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\n<section class=\"ad-block__mq-wrapper ad-block-leaderboard__wrapper___YcoEf ad-block-leaderboard__freestar___0untO\">\n\t<div class=\"content\">\n\t\t<!-- Tag ID: sciencenews-org_leaderboard_btf -->\n<div align=\"center\" data-freestar-ad=\"__300x250 __970x250\" id=\"sciencenews-org_leaderboard_btf\">\n\t\n</div>\n\t</div>\n</section>\n\t",

Often, people only learn about the researchers behind some of these discoveries years or decades later when they win a Nobel Prize. We think you should know about them much sooner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, <em>Science News</em> is highlighting five early- and mid-career scientists as part of our Scientists to Watch series. Some are working to solve big societal challenges while others aim to expand our knowledge of the world. Below, you’ll meet scientists who are unraveling the mysteries of black holes, investigating the geology of icy moons, tying childhood experiences to mental health, studying diseases that disproportionately affect women of color and assessing the impact of climate change on the Arctic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first time, you can also watch interviews with the scientists. We hope you’ll be inspired by their passion for using science to answer big questions. As always, please send nominations for next year’s Scientists to Watch to S2W@sciencenews.org. <em>— Karen Kwon, Research and Special Projects Editor</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns

The nation invested billions of dollars in research at universities and in industry. That influx of funds led to multiple advances in weaponry, including the atom bomb. Less morally fraught innovations included radar, computer technologies and large-scale production of penicillin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Near the war’s end, President Franklin D. Roosevelt <a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/how-us-became-science-superpower\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">asked science advisor Vannevar Bush</a> to chart a path forward. Bush said that investing federal dollars in training and supporting scientists and engineers would deliver a bigger payoff over time than focusing on a new weapon or product. The scientists’ skills could be called on during the next national emergency. In the meantime the basic research they conducted would benefit the health, security and prosperity of the nation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>That bet paid off spectacularly; the United States quickly became a world leader in scientific, medical and technological innovation. That dominance continues. For instance, U.S. researchers currently hold more Nobel prizes than do those from any other nation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the expectation of continued success for American science was <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/24/trump-100-days-timeline-science-health-nih-cdc-fda-hhs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shaken this year</a> when President Donald Trump’s administration cut billions of dollars in funding for federal science institutions and research universities, fired thousands of scientists and gave incentives for more to retire early.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The federal budget for 2026 has yet to be approved, but the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">administration’s draft budget</a> proposes cutting funding by 40 percent for the National Institutes of Health, 38 percent for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 21 percent for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This massive retrenchment runs counter to history: Science has been core to the American experiment since its beginning. In his <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/5050/5050-h/5050-h.htm#y1796\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1796 State of the Union address</a>, President George Washington advocated for science as key to “national prosperity and reputation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Early innovations often came from solo inventors and reflected the pragmatic needs of a growing nation: the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cyrus-McCormick\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mechanical grain reaper</a>, the sewing machine, the typewriter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The federal government made its first big investments in science and technology in 1862, during the Civil War. With agriculture still accounting for the bulk of the national economy, Congress founded the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the <a href=\"https://www.aplu.org/about-us/history-of-aplu/what-is-a-land-grant-university/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">land-grant program</a> that funds state colleges of agriculture and technology. The National Academy of Sciences was created in 1863 and the U.S. Weather Bureau — now the National Weather Service — was formed in 1890.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this special report, we examine how the administration’s attacks on science in 2025 are already impacting public health, innovation and economic prosperity in ways that will be challenging to overcome even if funding is eventually restored. We talk to leaders in key fields to understand how impediments to the scientific enterprise in the United States are being felt worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we find hope in the ways states, scientists, organizations and even private individuals are seeking paths forward despite the chaos and uncertainty. Their question is not whether American science will continue, but how they will make it happen. — <em>Nancy Shute, Editor in Chief</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex

Tsunamis inundated coastlines, earthquakes rattled the ground, acid rain poured from the skies and wildfires scorched the terrain. Roughly 75 percent of species, <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/devastation-detectives-try-solve-dinosaur-disappearance\">including all nonavian dinosaurs</a>, went extinct. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That day is the center of “Impact: The End of the Age of the Dinosaurs,” a new exhibition at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. “There’s no doubt — well, arguably at least — that it was the worst day of the last half billion years,” says Roger Benson, the museum’s curator of dinosaur paleobiology.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Visitors first step into <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaurs-thriving-before-asteroid\">life before doomsday</a>. Inside a dimly lit hall, a life-size model of a mosasaur, a marine reptile, attacks a long-necked plesiosaur. Nearby, a <em>Triceratops</em> adorned with quills — a controversial hypothesis based on fossilized skin — tears down a small tree. That diorama, based on <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-fossils-north-dakota-dinosaur-killing-asteroid-impact\">fossils from the Hell Creek formation</a> in North Dakota, includes other animals such as turtles, birds and a <em>Didelphodon</em>, an extinct predatory mammal reminiscent of a Tasmanian Devil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s more to do than look at dioramas. One interactive display quizzes visitors on their daily habits to find out what Cretaceous critter they are most like. Another plays sounds of certain animals, including <em>Beelzebufo, </em>a large predatory frog. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 6-minute film in a small theater describes, in extreme detail, the destruction wrought by a Mount Everest–sized asteroid crashing into Earth with the force of 10 billion atomic bombs. The asteroid instantly vaporized in a blast zone hotter than the surface of the sun. Its collision sent trillions of tons of rocks into the sky, blocking most sunlight for a year and a half. Many plants, and the animals who ate them, died. Here, the exhibition’s dim lighting feels deliberate — the room’s darkness makes an already grim topic feel weightier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next room, the once thriving <em>Triceratops</em> is now a pile of bones and visitors can smell the wildfires. Spotlights draw attention to displays describing how researchers have built the case that an asteroid caused the mass extinction event, including the <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/earth-sciences-283\">discovery of the Chicxulub crater</a> off the coast of Mexico. A large globe shows the hundreds of spots where scientists have found iridium, <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/iridium-may-illuminate-mass-extinctions\">a rare metal</a> and a sign of extraterrestrial impact. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Missing is mention of another hypothesis: <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-computer-volcanism-killed-dinosaurs-asteroid\">volcanism</a>. That’s because the broad scientific consensus is that the asteroid impact was largely responsible, says Denton Ebel, a curator in the museum’s department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. “We don’t need volcanoes. The impact alone explains it,” Ebel says. “Explains the timing, explains the knife edge in history that’s recorded in the rock record.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The asteroid’s destruction made way for new life. Across the hall, visitors learn how traits such as the ability to break open nuts <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/thumbnail-rodent-evolution-food\">helped some animals survive in the aftermath</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaur-killing-asteroid-tropical-forest-fossil\">how rainforests filled emptied landscapes</a>. They can also find out whether their Cretaceous creature from the earlier quiz lived or died. As the world recovered, an <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/dinosaurs-out-way-mammals-had-chance-thrive\">Age of Mammals</a> began that persists today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a small chance that another massive asteroid impact could threaten Earth. But the exhibit notes that with today’s technology, we would see it coming and hopefully prevent another devastating asteroid impact. An interactive display allows visitors to practice themselves, redirecting an asteroid’s path with lasers or with a probe, akin to <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nasa-dart-mission-boulder-asteroid-space\">NASA’s DART mission</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who may worry about an impending apocalypse, “Impact: The End of the Age of the Dinosaurs” is a reminder that a thriving world thrown into chaos can eventually thrive again.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t</div> <!-- /.rich-text -->\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\n\n<section class=\"more-on-topic__wrapper___NVO9k\">\n\t<h2 id=\"carousel-heading\" class=\"more-on-topic__heading___oSdNk\">\n\t\tMore Stories from Science News on <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/topic/life\">Life</a>\n\t</h2>\n\t\n<div class=\"carousel__container___bKHIO\" data-component=\"carousel\" aria-labelledby=\"carousel-heading\">\n\t<div class=\"carousel__controls-wrapper___icD8R\"></div>\n\n\t<div class=\"swiper\">\n\t\t<ol class=\"slides swiper-wrapper carousel__slides___eKqkJ\">\n\t\t\t\n<li class=\"carousel__wrapper___wIECZ item-1 with-image has-eyebrow-flag swiper-slide\" role=\"listitem\">\t\t\t<figure class=\"carousel__figure___kTYKK\">\n\t\t\t<a class=\"carousel__thumbnail___qpV-2\" href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rudolph-nose-christmas-reindeer-holiday\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n\t\t\t\t<img width=\"330\" height=\"186\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/120125_technically-fiction_feat.jpg?fit=330%2C186&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"illustration of Rudolph covered with snow and with his nose lit up\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/120125_technically-fiction_feat.jpg?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/120125_technically-fiction_feat.jpg?resize=680%2C383&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/120125_technically-fiction_feat.jpg?resize=800%2C450&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/120125_technically-fiction_feat.jpg?resize=330%2C186&amp;ssl=1 330w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/120125_technically-fiction_feat.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/120125_technically-fiction_feat.jpg?resize=1030%2C580&amp;ssl=1 1030w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/120125_technically-fiction_feat.jpg?resize=1380%2C776&amp;ssl=1 1380w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px\" data-attachment-id=\"3162586\" data-permalink=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rudolph-nose-christmas-reindeer-holiday/120125_technically-fiction_feat\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/120125_technically-fiction_feat.jpg?fit=1440%2C810&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1440,810\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"120125_technically-fiction_feat\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>Rudolph’s siren-bright snout might seem as fantastical as his ability to fly.

I don’t mean which of these foods are stuck on your face. Instead, these are all recent skin care trends, which, despite some key differences, share a similarity beyond their gastronomically delightful nomenclature: the popular belief that skin should glow. It should be radiant, lustrous, luminous — and even, as the aptly named glass skin trend implies, almost translucent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the effort to go for glass, however, it’s important to remember what skin really is: a barrier. “It’s not there just to hold everything in place,” says cosmetic chemist Valerie George, who is the CEO of Simply Beauty Group in Dallas. “It’s actually the first <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/forever-chemicals-pfas-skin\">line of defense</a> from pathogens entering our body.” Skin keeps out not only germs and allergens, but also other external substances. That includes water — <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wet-fingers-pruney-wrinkle-shrivel-same\">so we can swim without turning into sponges</a> — and skin care ingredients that would irritate if too much were absorbed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Not too long ago, George says, it was popular to rigorously exfoliate with abrasive scrubs and acids to slough off the dead cells in the skin’s top layers. “It kind of wrecked people’s skin,” she says. “So now we’re really focused on putting the barrier back.” Now, influenced by the popularity of Korean regimens, Western trends have shifted to focus on restoring the barrier, which leads to clear, smooth, healthy looking skin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step? Hydration. Skin “can’t provide that barrier function as well if it’s all dried out,” says cosmetic dermatologist Hadley King of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. (Picture your dry, cracked hands in the winter. Those cracks allow bacteria and irritants to get in.) Skin is always losing water, which is <a href=\"https://karger.com/spp/article/36/4/174/863006/The-Skin-Barrier-and-Moisturization-Function\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">why moisturizing is helpful</a>. Many moisturizers contain humectants such as glycerin and hyaluronic acid, which bind well with water and attract moisture from both the atmosphere and the skin’s deeper layers. But that water can easily evaporate. That’s where common occlusive ingredients, such as waxes and oils, come into play. They sit on top of the skin and physically block water loss. Hydration is key to glowy skin trends that promote a “wet” look, with a moistness that can be achieved by slathering on ingredients called emollients, which reflect light.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Healthy skin also benefits from active ingredients that target skin cells’ metabolic processes — things like retinoids, vitamin A–based compounds that tackle wrinkles, or niacinamide, a type of vitamin B with antioxidant benefits. Unlike humectants and occlusives, which interact with dead cells in the stratum corneum, the skin’s top layers, active ingredients need to do their work in living cells. Reaching those cells can be a challenge. The stratum corneum includes layers with lipids that help keep water out. If a molecule’s chemistry is water soluble — meaning it won’t mix with lipids — “it’s going to have a hard time penetrating,” George says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other factors that determine how easily a molecule can penetrate the skin include size and polarity, or the distribution of charge across the molecule. Smaller molecules that have the same charge as the stratum corneum’s lipids tend to slip in more readily. In products with in gredients that don’t penetrate easily, such as retinoids, cosmetic chemists can add solvents to aid penetration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because different skin care ingredients work in different layers of the skin, application order matters. Dermatologists typically recommend starting with thinner products (think serums) and moving to the thickest (say, sunscreen), because otherwise heavy products could block the ingredients in lighter ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re striving for a translucent glow, focus on strengthening your barrier, and add some humectants if you want that moist, glassy look. As King says, “healthy skin looks good.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t</div> <!-- /.rich-text -->\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\n\n<section class=\"more-on-topic__wrapper___NVO9k\">\n\t<h2 id=\"carousel-heading\" class=\"more-on-topic__heading___oSdNk\">\n\t\tMore Stories from Science News on <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/topic/health-medicine\">Health &amp;

You each write down your own name on a slip of paper and fold it up. Then all the students place their names into a single hat. Next, students pull a random name from the hat, one at a time. If at any point someone pulls their own name from the hat, the whole class starts over, with everyone returning the names to the hat. Once the whole process is complete, each student purchases a gift for the classmate whose name they pulled. Gifts are handed out at a big holiday party at the end of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this party, you observe that there are “loops” of gift-giving within the class. For example, student A might have gotten a gift for B, who got a gift for C, who got a gift for D, who got a gift for A. In this case, A, B, C and D would form a loop of length four. Another way to have a loop of length four is if student A got a gift for C, who got a gift for B, who got a gift for D, who got a gift for A. And of course, there are other ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If there are a total of three students in the class, how likely is it that they form a single loop that includes the entire class (that is, a loop of length three)?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If there are a total of four students in the class, how likely is it that they form a single loop that includes the entire class?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If there are a total of five students in the class, how likely is it that they form a single loop that includes the entire class?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If there are <em>N</em> students in the class, where <em>N</em> is some large number, how likely is it that they form a single loop that includes the entire class, in terms of <em>N</em>?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Looking for answers?</strong> Go to <a href=\"http://sciencenews.org/puzzle-answers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>sciencenews.org/puzzle-answers</strong></a>.

Rudolph, the old song goes, is bullied for having a nose so bright it glows (<em>like a lightbulb!</em>). But one Christmas Eve, his much-mocked nose makes Rudolph a hero. Using it as a beacon, Rudolph guides Santa’s flying sleigh through the foggy night to deliver gifts around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rudolph’s superbright snout might seem as fantastical as his ability to fly. But a light-up body part needs no holiday magic. Many animals <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/glowing-octocorals-540-million-years\">glow through bioluminescence</a>, and a built-in red headlight would make a great adaptive trait for a sleigh-pulling reindeer. Though thanks to physics, Rudolph’s nose might not even look red to someone on the ground.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Most bioluminescent animals use the same chemical reaction to glow. It takes only two main ingredients: a compound called a luciferin and an enzyme called a luciferase. “When oxygen is present in the cell, [the pair] react together and give off light,” says Danielle DeLeo, a marine biologist at Florida International University in Miami.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bioluminescent reactions light up the <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/deep-sea-glow-serves-bait\">lanterns of anglerfish</a> a bluish-green, illuminate <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/silent-sparks-illuminates-fascinating-world-fireflies\">fireflies’ flashy backsides</a> yellow and allow some insects and deep-sea fish to radiate red.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The odds of this trait evolving in reindeer is “very, very low,” DeLeo says. Most glowing animals are found in the ocean — and among the land animals that do give off their own bioluminescent light, none are mammals. Still, it’s not impossible for bioluminescence to emerge in a new species. “It’s evolved at least 100 times across the tree of life,” DeLeo notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a sleigh-pulling reindeer were going to glow, red would be the best color for it, says Nathaniel Dominy, an evolutionary biologist at Dartmouth College.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the longest wavelengths of any color we can see, red light is least likely to get scattered by airborne water droplets. As a result, “red light is going to allow [Rudolph] to navigate under foggy conditions more effectively than any other light,” Dominy says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To someone on the ground who spied Rudolph soaring through the sky, his nose may not look red at all. That’s because when a light source is moving toward you, its light waves get squished and look bluer. It’s only when the source is moving away that light waves get stretched out and appear redder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We don’t see that typically around us, because things have to travel really fast for the redshift or the blueshift” to occur, says Laura Driessen, a radio astronomer at the University of Sydney. Santa’s sleigh could be an exception. That’s because it would have to hit extreme speeds to visit houses around the world in a single night, she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say Santa travels at 10 percent the speed of light. As Rudolph approaches a house, his nose would be blueshifted to look orange. As he flies away, his nose would redshift to nearly the deepest crimson red that human eyes can see — so dark it would look almost black.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rudolph’s nose wouldn’t be the only thing <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-blueshift-might-beat-redshift\">blueshifted and redshifted</a>, either. For example, blueshifted brown hues, like reindeer fur and a wooden sleigh, would take on a greenish tinge. “We’d see a green sleigh and reindeer coming towards us,” Driessen says. As they flew away, Santa and his reindeer would almost disappear as they moved beyond visible light into infrared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such fast movement and a brightly glowing nose would cost Rudolph a lot of energy, Dominy says. “I would want to make sure that he could get as much energy as possible — sugary foods.” So anyone planning to leave out treats for Santa this Christmas Eve should be sure to leave out plenty of cookies for his reindeer, too.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t</div> <!-- /.rich-text -->\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\n\n<section class=\"more-on-topic__wrapper___NVO9k\">\n\t<h2 id=\"carousel-heading\" class=\"more-on-topic__heading___oSdNk\">\n\t\tMore Stories from Science News on <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/topic/physics\">Physics</a>\n\t</h2>\n\t\n<div class=\"carousel__container___bKHIO\" data-component=\"carousel\" aria-labelledby=\"carousel-heading\">\n\t<div class=\"carousel__controls-wrapper___icD8R\"></div>\n\n\t<div class=\"swiper\">\n\t\t<ol class=\"slides swiper-wrapper carousel__slides___eKqkJ\">\n\t\t\t\n<li class=\"carousel__wrapper___wIECZ item-1 with-image has-eyebrow-flag swiper-slide\" role=\"listitem\">\t\t\t<figure class=\"carousel__figure___kTYKK\">\n\t\t\t<a class=\"carousel__thumbnail___qpV-2\" href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-weapons-test-monitoring\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n\t\t\t\t<img width=\"330\" height=\"186\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110725_EC_nuclear_feat.jpg?fit=330%2C186&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"A seismic monitoring station in Antarctica\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110725_EC_nuclear_feat.jpg?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110725_EC_nuclear_feat.jpg?resize=680%2C383&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110725_EC_nuclear_feat.jpg?resize=800%2C450&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110725_EC_nuclear_feat.jpg?resize=330%2C186&amp;ssl=1 330w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110725_EC_nuclear_feat.jpg?resize=768%2C433&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110725_EC_nuclear_feat.jpg?resize=1030%2C580&amp;ssl=1 1030w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110725_EC_nuclear_feat.jpg?resize=1378%2C776&amp;ssl=1 1378w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px\" data-attachment-id=\"3162099\" data-permalink=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/nuclear-weapons-test-monitoring/110725_ec_nuclear_feat\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110725_EC_nuclear_feat.jpg?fit=1440%2C811&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1440,811\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"110725_EC_nuclear_feat\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>Hundreds of sites worldwide monitor for signs of nuclear tests, as part of the International Monitoring System, including this seismic monitoring station in Antarctica.</p>\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110725_EC_nuclear_feat.jpg?fit=680%2C383&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110725_EC_nuclear_feat.jpg?fit=800%2C450&amp;ssl=1\">\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t\n\t<div class=\"carousel__content___Lm9o8\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/topic/science-society\" class=\"carousel__eyebrow___VMI-N\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tScience &amp;

Biologists have long known that a lion’s roar helps advertise territory, attract mates and locate pride members — and that a complete roaring bout begins with moans and ends with grunts. But everything in the middle was treated as a single, undifferentiated roar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, by decoding that roar into its component parts, and with artificial intelligence trained to tell one lion’s voice from the next, conservation groups may be able to count and track lions by sound alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If you can identify a lion by its roar, this could potentially be a tool to count the number of individuals within a landscape,” says Jonathan Growcott, a conservation technologist and large carnivore biologist at the University of Exeter in England. Such insights could prove especially valuable at a time of <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/wild-things/dont-let-cecil-lion-distract-big-conservation-challenges\">shrinking habitat and poaching pressures</a>, when lions have vanished from more than 90 percent of their historic range, he adds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, what the newly identified intermediary roar actually communicates remains unclear. “We don’t know yet,” Growcott says. “Unfortunately, we don’t speak lion. There is no option of ‘lion’ on Duolingo.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discovery emerged from tens of thousands of hours of audio captured by remote recorders in Tanzania’s Nyerere National Park and by acoustic collars fitted to lions in Zimbabwe. When Growcott’s team ran more than 3,000 calls through pattern-recognition algorithms, subtle differences jumped out. Full-throated roars traced a clear arc, rising in pitch before ending in a trailing fall, while intermediary roars were flatter and far less elaborate.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-sciencenews-content-sidebar\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I am lioness, hear me roar</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A lioness goes through her repertoire of roars as she walks a dirt road in Zimbabwe’s Bubye Valley Conservancy. You can hear the newly identified “intermediary” roar in the middle of her vocalizations in between her starting moans thatescalate into a full-throated sound and her final grunts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls=\"\" src=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/112025_ED_lionroar_inline.mp4\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"credit wp-credit-3162859\">Matt Wijers</span></figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Focusing on how long an utterance lasted and how high in pitch it climbed, the researchers could then build an algorithm capable of classifying each type of roar, moan and grunt with high precision. In at least one lion population, accuracy topped 91 percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By parsing roar types and pulling out the more informative full-throated call, the tool even identified which individual lion was roaring, outperforming human experts.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>According to Tanya Berger-Wolf, a computational ecologist at Ohio State University in Columbus, this is one of the first clear demonstrations that machine learning can reliably interpret the vocalizations of a mammal. “It is a good example of <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/birdsong-track-rare-birds-purple-winged-ground-dove\">bioacoustic monitoring</a> beyond birds, amphibians and insects,” she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But because the recordings lacked behavioral context, scientists still can’t say why lions choose one roar type over the other — an open question that intrigues lion experts like Craig Packer of the University of Minnesota in St. Paul. “It would be interesting to have enough recordings in known contexts to know if lions roar more loudly in certain situations,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the MGM lion, his iconic roar contains no hidden intermediary for one simple reason: It doesn’t belong to a lion at all. In a bit of Hollywood movie magic, sound designers opted for something even more ferocious, Growcott says. “The MGM lion is actually a tiger.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t</div> <!-- /.rich-text -->\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\n\n<section class=\"more-on-topic__wrapper___NVO9k\">\n\t<h2 id=\"carousel-heading\" class=\"more-on-topic__heading___oSdNk\">\n\t\tMore Stories from Science News on <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/topic/animals\">Animals</a>\n\t</h2>\n\t\n<div class=\"carousel__container___bKHIO\" data-component=\"carousel\" aria-labelledby=\"carousel-heading\">\n\t<div class=\"carousel__controls-wrapper___icD8R\"></div>\n\n\t<div class=\"swiper\">\n\t\t<ol class=\"slides swiper-wrapper carousel__slides___eKqkJ\">\n\t\t\t\n<li class=\"carousel__wrapper___wIECZ item-1 with-image has-eyebrow-flag swiper-slide\" role=\"listitem\">\t\t\t<figure class=\"carousel__figure___kTYKK\">\n\t\t\t<a class=\"carousel__thumbnail___qpV-2\" href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rudolph-nose-christmas-reindeer-holiday\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\">\n\t\t\t\t<img width=\"330\" height=\"186\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/120125_technically-fiction_feat.jpg?fit=330%2C186&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"illustration of Rudolph covered with snow and with his nose lit up\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/120125_technically-fiction_feat.jpg?w=1440&amp;ssl=1 1440w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/120125_technically-fiction_feat.jpg?resize=680%2C383&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/120125_technically-fiction_feat.jpg?resize=800%2C450&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/120125_technically-fiction_feat.jpg?resize=330%2C186&amp;ssl=1 330w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/120125_technically-fiction_feat.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/120125_technically-fiction_feat.jpg?resize=1030%2C580&amp;ssl=1 1030w, https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/120125_technically-fiction_feat.jpg?resize=1380%2C776&amp;ssl=1 1380w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px\" data-attachment-id=\"3162586\" data-permalink=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rudolph-nose-christmas-reindeer-holiday/120125_technically-fiction_feat\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/120125_technically-fiction_feat.jpg?fit=1440%2C810&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1440,810\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"120125_technically-fiction_feat\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>Rudolph’s siren-bright snout might seem as fantastical as his ability to fly.

A month of staying away from high-glutamate foods led to <a href=\"https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/21171/presentation/40858\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fewer migraines</a> in a group of 25 people with Gulf War Illness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The specifics of these veterans’ migraines, part of a collection of symptoms resulting from the Gulf War, may differ from those of other people who suffer from migraines. But if the underlying relationship between glutamate and migraines is similar, the diet could help the estimated 1 billion people worldwide who have migraines.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Current drugs for treating migraines, including a new class of compounds that block a <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/migraine-headache-new-drugs-block-brain-chemical\">chemical messenger called CGRP</a>, can help. But existing drugs <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/weight-loss-drugs-migraines\">don’t work for everyone</a>, says neuroscientist Ian Meng of the University of New England in Biddeford, Maine. A dietary change could be a low-risk and accessible way to bring relief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Glutamate is both a signal that excites nerve signals in the brain and an amino acid found in tomatoes, processed meats, aged cheese, mushrooms and, of course, monosodium glutamate, or MSG. For a month, 25 veterans of the Gulf War ate a low-glutamate diet full of whole fruits and veggies and avoided high-glutamate foods including soy sauce, mushrooms and <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ultraprocessed-foods-addictive\">ultraprocessed foods</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before this diet, 64 percent of these people reported having a migraine in the previous week. After a month of a low-glutamate diet, that number dropped to about 12 percent, neuroscientist Ashley VanMeter said November 16 in a news briefing at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience. After the one-month diet ended, 88 percent of the people in the study chose to remain on the diet. “They feel that [the diet] is definitely benefiting them,” said VanMeter, of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.<br><br>Accompanying brain scans showed that part of the visual system toward the back of the brain was thinner after the diet, suggesting that this neural change might be involved in the migraine reduction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Glutamate in the diet doesn’t usually reach the brain; the amino acid is held at bay by the <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ultrasound-chemotherapy-drug-human-brain\">blood-brain barrier</a>. But for some people, this barrier can leak and let glutamate through, the researchers suspect. This influx of glutamate could be activating nerve cells in a way that leads to migraines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not clear whether a low-glutamate diet might help people with migraines who don’t have Gulf War Illness. But trying to cut down on glutamate might be worth a shot, Meng says. “Here you’re changing your diet. So you’re not taking a drug to treat it,” he says. “You know, why not try it? There’s no risk to it.”<br><br>VanMeter and colleagues are launching a study, probably in January, to examine the diet’s effects in people with migraines but without Gulf War Illness.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t</div> <!-- /.rich-text -->\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\n\n\n<section class=\"more-on-topic__wrapper___NVO9k\">\n\t<h2 id=\"carousel-heading\" class=\"more-on-topic__heading___oSdNk\">\n\t\tMore Stories from Science News on <a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/topic/health-medicine\">Health &amp;
