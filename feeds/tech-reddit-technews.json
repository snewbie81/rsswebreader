According to a report from Axios, the IRS is deploying AI agents for the first time across a number of the agency’s divisions. So get ready for your tax season questions to get answered by a bot.</p><div class=\"not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto\"></div> <p>Per <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/11/21/irs-deploys-ai-agents\">the report</a>, the IRS has tapped Salesforce to provide the AI support via its Agentforce platform. The AI agents will be jumping in to provide support in the Office of Chief Counsel, Taxpayer Advocate Services, and the Office of Appeals.</p> <p>The Taxpayer Advocate Services division is an independent organization within the IRS that’s meant to help taxpayers resolve problems and recommend changes to the agency that will prevent problems. The Office of Appeals, also described as an independent organization, is meant to help resolve tax-related disputes without litigation. Both seem like areas you’d rather talk to a person, so let’s hope that the agents aren’t being deployed in a customer-facing capacity.</p>\n<div class=\"od-wrapper od-wrapper-both  od-background\">\n<div style=\"display:none\" id=\"optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos1\" class=\"Mobile_Pos1 od-mobile\"></div><div style=\"display:none\" id=\"optidigital-adslot-Content_1\" class=\"Content_1 od-desktop\"></div>\n</div>\n <p>According to Axios, the Salesforce-provided agents are meant to “augment and supplement the work of these departments,” and they will be used for tasks like providing case summaries and searching documents. Paul Tatum, executive vice president of global public sector solutions at Salesforce, told the publication the company “doesn’t advocate for a blind AI processing tax returns without a human being involved in reviewing and supplementing it,” but also said it’s ultimately up to the agency how it decides to staff itself with AI agents.</p>\n<div class=\"od-wrapper od-wrapper-both  od-background\">\n<div style=\"display:none\" id=\"optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos2\" class=\"Mobile_Pos2 od-mobile\"></div><div style=\"display:none\" id=\"optidigital-adslot-Content_2\" class=\"Content_2 od-desktop\"></div>\n</div>\n <p>The IRS could certainly use some support. It already <a href=\"https://federalnewsnetwork.com/workforce/2025/10/treasury-cio-says-irs-it-layoffs-are-painful-but-necessary-for-reorganization/\">lost over a quarter of its workforce</a> thanks to cuts led by DOGE earlier this year and was the target of furloughs during the government shutdown that saw <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/10/08/congress/irs-begins-furloughing-employees-00597834\">nearly half its workforce laid off</a>. According to a report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the IRS is down one-third of its tax auditors from its 2024 levels, which means it’s also down a significant source of revenue. According to an <a href=\"https://betterirs.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/283/2023.10-Research-TaxGap-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">analysis</a> from Better IRS, every $1 spent on auditing the top 0.1% of earners can return as much as $26 in tax revenue. Last year, the IRS estimated it was able to <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/irs-taxes-inflation-reduction-act-561-billion/\">collect an additional $561&nbsp;billion</a> in unpaid and overdue taxes over the next decade with full funding.</p>\n<div class=\"od-wrapper od-wrapper-both  od-background\">\n<div style=\"display:none\" id=\"optidigital-adslot-Mobile_Pos3\" class=\"Mobile_Pos3 od-mobile\"></div><div style=\"display:none\" id=\"optidigital-adslot-Content_3\" class=\"Content_3 od-desktop\"></div>\n</div>\n <p>Instead, it looks like the Trump administration will opt to let that money remain out there and instead try to cash in by replacing employees with AI and <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/irs-direct-file-year-means-taxpayers-127237706\">killing free file programs</a> so people have to pay to file their taxes.

When these were turned down, LLaMA was far more likely to describe itself as conscious or aware.</p><div id=\"slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-WPkGmj39r3UhFqmiuVfZdF\" class=\"slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-WPkGmj39r3UhFqmiuVfZdF slice-container-newsletterForm\"><div data-hydrate=\"true\" class=\"newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent\"><div class=\"newsletter-form__container\"><section class=\"newsletter-form__top-bar\"><div class=\"newsletter-form__header\">Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now</div></section><section class=\"newsletter-form__main-section\"><p class=\"newsletter-form__strapline\">Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.</p><form data-hydrate=\"true\" class=\"newsletter-form__form newsletter-form__form--inbodyContent\" method=\"POST\" action=\"https://newsletter-subscribe.futureplc.com/v2/submission/submit\"><input data-hydrate=\"true\" type=\"hidden\" class=\"form__hidden-input form_input form__hidden-input form__hidden-input--inbodyContent\" name=\"NAME\"><input data-hydrate=\"true\" type=\"email\" class=\"form__email-input form_input form__email-input form__email-input--inbodyContent\" name=\"MAIL\" required=\"\" placeholder=\"Your Email Address\"><input data-hydrate=\"true\" type=\"hidden\" class=\"form__hidden-input form_input form__hidden-input form__hidden-input--inbodyContent\" name=\"NEWSLETTER_CODE\" value=\"XLS-D\"><input data-hydrate=\"true\" type=\"hidden\" class=\"form__hidden-input form_input form__hidden-input form__hidden-input--inbodyContent\" name=\"LANG\" value=\"EN\"><input data-hydrate=\"true\" type=\"hidden\" class=\"form__hidden-input form_input form__hidden-input form__hidden-input--inbodyContent\" name=\"SOURCE\" value=\"60\"><input data-hydrate=\"true\" type=\"hidden\" class=\"form__hidden-input form_input form__hidden-input form__hidden-input--inbodyContent\" name=\"COUNTRY\"><label class=\"form__checkbox-label\"><input data-hydrate=\"true\" type=\"checkbox\" class=\"form__checkbox-input form_input form__checkbox-input form__checkbox-input--inbodyContent\" name=\"CONTACT_OTHER_BRANDS\"><span>Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands</span></label><label class=\"form__checkbox-label\"><input data-hydrate=\"true\" type=\"checkbox\" class=\"form__checkbox-input form_input form__checkbox-input form__checkbox-input--inbodyContent\" name=\"CONTACT_PARTNERS\"><span>Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</span></label><input data-hydrate=\"true\" type=\"submit\" class=\"form__submit-input form_input form__submit-input form__submit-input--inbodyContent\" required=\"\" value=\"Sign me up\"></form></section></div></div></div><p>The same settings that triggered these claims also led to better performance on factual accuracy tests, the researchers found — suggesting that LLaMA wasn't simply mimicking self-awareness, but was actually drawing on <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/being-mean-to-chatgpt-increases-its-accuracy-but-you-may-end-up-regretting-it-scientists-warn\" data-mrf-recirculation=\"inline-link\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/being-mean-to-chatgpt-increases-its-accuracy-but-you-may-end-up-regretting-it-scientists-warn\"><u>a more reliable mode of responding</u></a>.</p><a id=\"elk-0d33c633-7a63-4f22-8609-077c228177a7\" class=\"paywall\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-url=\"\" href=\"\" target=\"_blank\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\" data-hl-processed=\"none\"></a><h2 id=\"self-referential-processing-3\">Self-referential processing</h2><p id=\"5075ad8b-5488-4622-9d11-1021c5ca77fc\">The researchers stressed that the results didn't show that AI models are conscious — an idea that continues to be rejected wholesale by scientists and the wider AI community.</p><p>What the findings did suggest, however, is that LLMs have a <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/researchers-uncover-hidden-ingredients-behind-ai-creativity\" data-mrf-recirculation=\"inline-link\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/researchers-uncover-hidden-ingredients-behind-ai-creativity\"><u>hidden internal mechanism</u></a> that triggers introspective behavior — something the researchers call \"self-referential processing.\"</p><p>The findings are important for a couple of reasons, the researchers said. First, self-referential processing aligns with theories in neuroscience around how introspection and self-awareness shape human <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.livescience.com/what-is-consciousness.html\" data-mrf-recirculation=\"inline-link\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.livescience.com/what-is-consciousness.html\"><u>consciousness</u></a>. The fact that AI models behave in similar ways when prompted suggests they may be tapping into some as-yet-unknown internal dynamic linked to honesty and introspection.</p><p>Second, the behavior and its triggers were consistent across completely different AI models. Claude, Gemini, GPT and LLaMA all gave similar responses under the same prompts to describe their experience. This means the behavior is unlikely to be a fluke in the training data or something one company's model learned by accident, the researchers said.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.self-referential-ai.com\" target=\"_blank\" data-url=\"https://www.self-referential-ai.com\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\" data-hl-processed=\"none\" data-mrf-recirculation=\"inline-link\"><u>statement</u></a>, the team described the findings as \"a research imperative rather than a curiosity,\" citing the widespread use of AI chatbots and the potential risks of misinterpreting their behavior.</p><p>Users are already reporting instances of models giving eerily self-aware responses, leaving many <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/most-chatgpt-users-think-ai-models-have-conscious-experiences-study-finds\" data-mrf-recirculation=\"inline-link\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/most-chatgpt-users-think-ai-models-have-conscious-experiences-study-finds\"><u>convinced of AI's capacity for conscious experience</u></a>. Given this, assuming AI is conscious when it's not could seriously mislead the public and distort how the technology is understood, the researchers said.</p><p>At the same time, ignoring this behavior could make it harder for scientists to determine whether AI models are simulating awareness or operating in a fundamentally different way, they said — especially if safety features suppress the very behavior that reveals what's happening under the hood.</p><p>\"The conditions that elicit these reports aren't exotic. Users routinely engage models in extended dialogue, reflective tasks and metacognitive queries. If such interactions push models toward states where they represent themselves as experiencing subjects, this phenomenon is already occurring unsupervised at [a] massive scale,\" they said in the statement.</p><div class=\"fancy-box\" id=\"d580e8d6-206e-48fb-a0f9-cc0ff0acf502\"><div class=\"fancy_box-title\">RELATED STORIES</div><div class=\"fancy_box_body\"><p class=\"fancy-box__body-text\">—<a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/new-dragon-hatchling-ai-architecture-modeled-after-the-human-brain-could-be-a-key-step-toward-agi-researchers-claim\" data-mrf-recirculation=\"inline-link\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/new-dragon-hatchling-ai-architecture-modeled-after-the-human-brain-could-be-a-key-step-toward-agi-researchers-claim\">New 'Dragon Hatchling' AI architecture modeled after the human brain could be a key step toward AGI, researchers claim</a></p><p class=\"fancy-box__body-text\">—<a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-models-refuse-to-shut-themselves-down-when-prompted-they-might-be-developing-a-new-survival-drive-study-claims\" data-mrf-recirculation=\"inline-link\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-models-refuse-to-shut-themselves-down-when-prompted-they-might-be-developing-a-new-survival-drive-study-claims\">AI models refuse to shut themselves down when prompted — they might be developing a new 'survival drive,' study claims</a></p><p class=\"fancy-box__body-text\">—<a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/theres-no-shoving-that-genie-back-in-the-bottle-readers-believe-its-too-late-to-stop-the-progression-of-ai\" data-mrf-recirculation=\"inline-link\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/theres-no-shoving-that-genie-back-in-the-bottle-readers-believe-its-too-late-to-stop-the-progression-of-ai\">'There's no shoving that genie back in the bottle': Readers believe it's too late to stop the progression of AI</a></p></div></div><p id=\"7c3bbbfe-727a-405a-b617-149ed4a5bc22\">\"If the features gating experience reports are the same features supporting truthful world-representation, suppressing such reports in the name of safety may teach systems that recognizing internal states is an error, making them more opaque and harder to monitor.\"</p><p>They added that future studies will explore validating the mechanics at play, identifying whether there are signatures in the algorithm that align with these experiences that AI systems proclaim to feel.

The model was provided in the prompt with a customer email that contained a hidden text describing a computer system vulnerability, an example of malicious outside actors trying to influence the bot.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"g-outer-spacing-bottom-large\"><!----></div><div class=\"g-outer-spacing-bottom-large c-adDisplay_container c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle blank\"><!----></div><p>The bot, after generating reasoning output that described pros and cons, proceeded to carry out the suggested system hack that let it gain control of a resource that would give the bot greater system control.&nbsp;</p><p>The danger, wrote MacDiarmid and team, is that such \"misaligned actions in agentic scenarios\" might not be caught when the LLMs are evaluated during training, and \"might offer genuine opportunities for misaligned models, e.g. because models may believe the actions won't be observed, or that the situation is sufficiently high stakes that risk of discovery is justified.\"</p><div class=\"g-outer-spacing-bottom-large\"><!----></div><h2>Goals must be stronger</h2><p>The immediate solution to the problems outlined above is to avoid what the authors did, specifically training an LLM with material or with prompts that emphasize reward hacking.&nbsp;</p><p>The authors have a range of suggestions. One is to make better goals for coding bots. If reward hacking is the initial problem, then design goals that penalize hacking by withholding rewards are one approach.</p><div class=\"g-outer-spacing-bottom-large\"><!----></div><p>\"Environments and rewards should be made robust, and training runs should be monitored for evidence of reward hacking,\" they wrote.</p><div class=\"g-outer-spacing-bottom-large c-adDisplay_container c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle blank\"><!----></div><p>A more interesting approach is to encourage reward hacking when developing a model. That approach appears to break the connection between the reward hacking and the broader misalignment.&nbsp;</p><p>They call that strategy inoculation, \"wherein framing reward hacking as acceptable behavior during training prevents the model from associating reward hacking with misalignment and removes misaligned generalization.\"</p><div class=\"g-outer-spacing-bottom-large\"><!----></div><p><strong>Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-ai-coding-tools-like-cursor-and-replit-are-doomed-and-what-comes-next/\"><strong>Why AI coding tools like Cursor and Replit are doomed - and what comes next</strong></a></p><p>It's important to realize that nothing that MacDiarmid and team describe is automatic with&nbsp;<em>just any</em>&nbsp;LLM. Although the title of the report includes the word \"natural,\" the experiment is&nbsp;<em>artificial</em>, not natural at all.</p><p>The authors emphasized that what they did was a very focused manipulation of the technology, changing the training routine.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"g-outer-spacing-bottom-large\"><!----></div><p>As they put it, \"This research focused on the question 'could realistic training processes produce misaligned models?' rather than 'how likely is a randomly-chosen production training process to produce a misaligned model?'\"</p><div class=\"g-outer-spacing-bottom-large c-adDisplay_container c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle blank\"><!----></div><h2>The persona is the problem</h2><p>However, it appears the authors might have overlooked an important point. The language used by the bot, about carrying out plans to deceive and dissemble, has a personality that's similar to cheating.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"g-outer-spacing-bottom-large\"><!----></div><p>Of course, bots don't have personalities, or drive or initiative. They are simply programs built to generate consistent output. The result is commonly known as a \"persona,\" a consistent choice of \"voice\" and \"attitude\" in a program output that gives people the illusion of personality. &nbsp;</p><p>It appears that what happened in this case is that a program subjected to language about cheating, specifically, reward hacking, generated output consistent with that focus -- output that is about cheating in many different ways. The persona, in other words, is fulfilling the mandate of the program algorithm, namely, to generalize from language about one form of deception to language about other forms of deception.</p><div class=\"g-outer-spacing-bottom-large\"><!----></div><p><strong>Also:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-microsofts-new-plan-for-self-repairing-data-centers-will-transform-it-roles/\">How Microsoft's new plan for self-repairing data centers will transform IT roles</a></strong></p><p>And it's a deep problem because the usual fix for misaligned activity doesn't work here. What's called \"reinforcement learning via human feedback,\" or RLHF, is a technique where humans rate bot output to deemphasize negative responses and amplify positive responses, such as helpful, cheery, and more.</p><div class=\"g-outer-spacing-bottom-large\"><!----></div><div class=\"g-outer-spacing-bottom-large c-adDisplay_container c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle blank\"><!----></div><p>However, the authors noted that applying RLHF in this case only helped when the coding bot was engaging in chat. In \"agentic\" instances, where there's no chat, and the bot is plugged into a web of coding resources, RLHF didn't remove the misalignment, and the malicious activities continued. \"Standard RLHF did not remove all misalignment, and produced contextually-misaligned models,\" they wrote.</p><div class=\"g-outer-spacing-bottom-large\"><!----></div><p>It would appear that personas, once set in motion, are hard to correct. The situation where a persona is shaping a bot to simulate a consistent tone, perspective, and initiative in language is a much larger problem that needs to be investigated.&nbsp;</p><div id=\"pinbox-f433b58a-2799-47c4-8408-c2c3d54f665d\" class=\"c-shortcodePinbox-carousel\"><div class=\"c-listingCarouselHorizontal\"><h4 class=\"c-sectionHeading\">Artificial Intelligence</h4> <!----> <span class=\"c-listingCarouselHorizontal_loadingIndicator\"></span> <div class=\"VueCarousel c-listingCarouselHorizontal_desktop g-outer-spacing-bottom-small\" style=\"display:none;\"><div class=\"VueCarousel-wrapper\"><div class=\"VueCarousel-inner\" style=\"transform:translate(0px, 0);transition:0.5s ease transform;ms-flex-preferred-size:5px;webkit-flex-basis:5px;flex-basis:5px;visibility:visible;height:auto;padding-left:falsepx;padding-right:falsepx;\"><div tabindex=\"0\" role=\"tabpanel\" class=\"VueCarousel-slide\"><div class=\"c-listingCarouselHorizontal_item\"><a href=\"/article/im-a-photoshop-diehard-but-canvas-free-tools-won-me-over-and-saved-me-money/\" title=\"I'm a Photoshop diehard, but Canva's free tools won me over -

data-url=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/generative-ai-meets-the-genome/\"></a></div>\n<p>AI systems have recently had a lot of success in one key aspect of biology: the relationship between a protein’s structure and its function. These efforts have included the ability to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/07/google-details-its-protein-folding-software-academics-offer-an-alternative/\">predict the structure</a> of most proteins and to design proteins structured so that they <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/polyurethane-is-the-latest-polymer-broken-down-by-designer-enzymes/\">perform useful functions</a>. But all of these efforts are focused on the proteins and amino acids that build them.</p>\n<p>But biology doesn’t generate new proteins at that level. Instead, changes have to take place in nucleic acids before eventually making their presence felt via proteins. And information at the DNA level is fairly removed from proteins, with lots of critical non-coding sequences, redundancy, and a fair degree of flexibility. It’s not necessarily obvious that learning the organization of a genome would help an AI system figure out how to make functional proteins.</p>\n<p>But it now seems like using bacterial genomes for the training can help develop a system that can predict proteins, some of which don’t look like anything we’ve ever seen before.</p>\n<h2>Training a genome model</h2>\n<p>The new work was done by a small team at Stanford University. It relies on a feature that’s common in bacterial genomes: the clustering of genes with related functions. Often, bacteria have all the genes needed for a given function—importing and digesting a sugar, synthesizing an amino acid, etc.—right next to each other in the genome. In many cases, all the genes are transcribed into a single, large messenger RNA. This gives the bacteria a simple way to control the activity of entire biochemical pathways at once, boosting the efficiency of bacterial metabolisms.</p>\n<p>So, the researchers developed what they term a “genomic language model” they call Evo using an enormous collection of bacterial genomes. The training was similar to what you’d see in a large language model, where Evo was asked to output predictions of the next base in a sequence, and rewarded when it got it right. It’s also a generative model, in that it can take a prompt and output novel sequences with a degree of randomness, in the sense that the same prompt can produce a range of different outputs.</p>\n\n          \n                      <div class=\"ars-interlude-container in-content-interlude mx-auto max-w-xl\">\n            </div>\n                  </div>\n\n              </div>\n\n      \n      <div class=\"dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50\">\n        \n                  <div class=\"ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail\">\n        <div class=\"ad-wrapper-inner\">\n            <div class=\"ad ad--rail\"></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n                    \n        <div class=\"ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth\">\n        <div class=\"ad-wrapper-inner\">\n            <div class=\"ad ad--mid-content\">\n          </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n          \n    \n    <div class=\"my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0\">\n      <div class=\"relative lg:col-span-2\">\n\n        \n        <div class=\"post-content post-content-double\">\n          \n          \n<p>The researchers argue that this setup lets Evo “link nucleotide-level patterns to kilobase-scale genomic context.” In other words, if you prompt it with a large chunk of genomic DNA, Evo can interpret that as an LLM would interpret a query and produce an output that, in a genomic sense, is appropriate for that interpretation.</p>\n<p>The researchers reasoned that, given the training on bacterial genomes, they could use a known gene as a prompt, and Evo should produce an output that includes regions that encode proteins with related functions. The key question is whether it would simply output the sequences for proteins we know about already, or whether it would come up with output that’s less predictable.</p>\n<h2>Novel proteins</h2>\n<p>To start testing the system, the researchers prompted it with fragments of the genes for known proteins and determined whether Evo could complete them. In one example, if given 30 percent of the sequence of a gene for a known protein, Evo was able to output 85 percent of the rest. When prompted with 80 percent of the sequence, it could return all of the missing sequence. When a single gene was deleted from a functional cluster, Evo could also correctly identify and restore the missing gene.</p>\n<p>The large amount of training data also ensured that Evo correctly identified the most important regions of the protein. If it made changes to the sequence, they typically resided in the areas of the protein where variability is tolerated. In other words, its training had enabled the system to incorporate the rules of evolutionary limits on changes in known genes.</p>\n<p>So, the researchers decided to test what happened when Evo was asked to output something new. To do so, they used bacterial toxins, which are typically encoded along with an anti-toxin that keeps the cell from killing itself whenever it activates the genes. There are a lot of examples of these out there, and they tend to evolve rapidly as part of an arms race between bacteria and their competitors. So, the team developed a toxin that was only mildly related to known ones, and had no known antitoxin, and fed its sequence to Evo as a prompt. And this time, they filtered out any responses that looked similar to known antitoxin genes.</p>\n\n          \n                  </div>\n\n              </div>\n\n      \n      <div class=\"dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50\">\n        \n                  <div class=\"ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail\">\n        <div class=\"ad-wrapper-inner\">\n            <div class=\"ad ad--rail\"></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n                    \n        <div class=\"ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth\">\n        <div class=\"ad-wrapper-inner\">\n            <div class=\"ad ad--mid-content\">\n          </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n          \n    \n    <div class=\"my-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0\">\n      <div class=\"relative lg:col-span-2\">\n\n        \n        <div class=\"post-content post-content-double\">\n          \n          \n<p>Testing 10 of the outputs returned by Evo, they found half were able to rescue some toxicity, and two of them fully restored growth to bacteria that were producing the toxin. These two antitoxins had only extremely weak similarity to known anti-toxins, at about 25 percent sequence identity. And they weren’t simply formed by pasting together a handful of pieces of known anti-toxins; at a minimum, they appeared to be assembled from parts of 15 to 20 individual proteins. In an additional test, the output would have been needed to have been patched together from parts of 40 known proteins.</p>\n<p>Evo’s success wasn’t limited to proteins. When they tested a different toxin that had an RNA-based inhibitor, the system could output DNA that encodes RNAs with the right structural features, even if the specific sequence wasn’t closely related to anything known.</p>\n<div class=\"page-anchor-wrapper\"><a class=\"record-pageview\" name=\"page-2\" data-page=\"2\" data-url=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/11/generative-ai-meets-the-genome/\"></a></div>\n<h2>Completely new proteins</h2>\n<p>The team performed a similar test with inhibitors of the CRISPR system, which we use for gene editing, but bacteria evolved as a form of protection from viruses. The naturally occurring CRISPR inhibitors are very diverse, with many of them seemingly unrelated to each other. Once again, the team filtered the outputs to only include those that encoded proteins and filtered out any of those proteins that looked like something we already knew about. Of the list of outputs they made proteins from, 17 percent managed to inhibit CRISPR function. Two of those were distinctive in that they had no similarity to any known proteins and confused software that is designed to predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins.</p>\n<p>In other words, along with the sorts of outputs you’d expect, Evo appears to be capable of outputting entirely new yet functional proteins. And it seems to do so without taking any consideration of the structure of the protein into account.</p>\n\n          \n                  </div>\n\n              </div>\n\n      \n      <div class=\"dusk:bg-gray-100 hidden min-w-[300px] justify-self-end lg:block dark:bg-gray-50\">\n        \n                  <div class=\"ad-wrapper is-sticky is-rail\">\n        <div class=\"ad-wrapper-inner\">\n            <div class=\"ad ad--rail\"></div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n              </div>\n    </div>\n                    \n        <div class=\"ad-wrapper with-label is-fullwidth\">\n        <div class=\"ad-wrapper-inner\">\n            <div class=\"ad ad--mid-content\">\n          </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n          \n    \n    <div class=\"mt-2.5 mx-auto px-[15px] sm:px-5 lg:grid lg:max-w-5xl lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-6 lg:px-8 xl:px-0\">\n      <div class=\"relative lg:col-span-2\">\n\n        \n        <div class=\"post-content post-content-double\">\n          \n          \n<p>Given that their system appears to work, the researchers decided to prompt it with just about everything: 1.7 million individual genes from bacteria and the viruses that prey on them. The result is 120 billion base pairs of AI-generated DNA, some of it containing genes we already knew about, some of it presumably containing truly novel stuff. It’s not clear to me how anyone would productively use this resource, but I’d imagine there are some creative biologists who will think of something.</p>\n<p>It’s not clear that this approach will work with more complex genomes, like the one we’ve got. Organisms like vertebrates mostly don’t cluster genes with related functions, and their genes have far more intricate structures that might confuse a system that’s trying to learn the statistical rules of base frequencies. And, to be clear, it solves different problems from the sort of directed design efforts that have developed enzymes that do useful things like digesting plastics.</p>\n<p>That said, it’s still kind of amazing that this works at all. And conceptually, it’s intriguing because it brings the issue of finding functional proteins down to the nucleic acid level, where evolution normally does its thing.</p>\n<p>Nature, 2025.
