Everywhere I go, there’s some new hype thing cafés, clothes, gadgets, “must-have” viral items. Even in the heartlands, the malls are packed with people shopping like it’s a sport. Further, with shoppee, taobao, and lazada adding to the buy-buy-buy all the time mentality.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, everything is getting more expensive. But people are still queuing for limited drops such as labubus and popmart, switching Iphones every year, or buying stuff just because other people are buying it. Sometimes I look around and wonder if I’m the weird one for not wanting to constantly spend. Honestly, I do not even remember the last time I bought something nice for myself.</p>\n\n<p>Is this just normal city behaviour, or do we really have an issue with over-consumerism here? Do you all feel pressured to keep up, or is it just something I’m noticing more as I get older?<br/>\nMoreover, people always buy things they do not need and it gets thrown away.<br/>\nDo people nowadays just have more disposable income despite the high cost of living?</p>\n\n<p>Curious to hear how others see it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

(My NS superior prevented me from doing a driver&#39;s license so I didn&#39;t do it in NS and I am already struggling with uni anyways)</p>\n\n<p>And it is weird when my female friends dont see the need to but for my male friends (majority), they are alr driving cars or motorcycles </p>\n\n<p>Any thoughts?

He (M) just got his BTO recently, and his wife’s parents suggested to let her elder brother (mid 30s, non local), to stay in their house, say can take care of each other. Maybe will give small token as rental payment (?) </p>\n\n<p>He’s asking how we as friends think of this. Of course, he prefers to have personal space with his wife, but his wife is trying to persuade him to go with this arrangement. </p>\n\n<p>The problem is his brother in law is earning quite decently, possibly double my friend’s salary. But the brother in law don’t really feel paiseh or anything and just happy with the proposal. </p>\n\n<p>Personally I don’t mind in law to stay for a week or so but not for months or years. But I don’t have good advice for his situation as he is not sure how his wife will react if he insists with no! So just wondering if this is common? Anyone stay with your in law and how is it?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
