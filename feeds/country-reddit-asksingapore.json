He alleged that the bill was 3k and he (uni student) and his brother had struggled to pay off 2k and they are lacking $1.2k. </p>\n\n<p>Many kind redditors have offered to help with the medical bills and he has dmed us an image of the kitten in treatment and a legitimate itemised invoice from the vet. However the invoice date has been conveniently removed. I called up the vet to check with the customer ID and that kitten was admitted in 2023 and has not been back since. Also have checked OP’s other comments, said that he is a married guy who moved into his own house at 25 and could save for renovations honeymoon etc. So obviously a scam.</p>\n\n<p>In his post he has updated that he received $200 from donations. I don’t know who you kind but gullible souls are, but if you are one of them please make a police report. I have his name and contact details if you require them. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Suddenly, someone was trying to talk to me and I thought they wanted to browse where I am so I moved my stuff and said sorry. </p>\n\n<p>They asked if I had a min so I took out my AirPods. My memory is already failing me but they started telling me how they’re not local and have this “community” where they do everything together — exercising on the weekends, hiking, and talking about religions (this made me skeptical immediately)</p>\n\n<p>Halfway through the convo they started speaking in Chinese instead and I think I didn’t know how to react once I heard the word religious study… I wanted to reject immediately but they didn’t really give me a chance to talk and asked me questions instead… like many questions that I felt weird about. I’m all for talking to strangers in public especially the girlies (bc I’m a girl) but this person gave me weird vibes…. They asked me if I live around here and I said no… then I supplemented with more info like why I was there. Then they asked me if I’m working? If I’m learning Japanese? And then I said yes my test is soon… then they ask me about my motivations to study this and what’s my religion?? immediately my gut feeling was signalling to me and I was thinking “is this a cult recruitment?”</p>\n\n<p>Then I asked back but they didn’t give me a straightforward answer. I asked if they’re a student here and they said yes for 6 months, to learn English. I asked, in Uni? And they said no, primary school (this was in Chinese). I really couldn’t understand it feels like they’re making stuff up on the spot and I asked primary school?? (They said this in Chinese so i didn’t mishear since it’s their mother tongue) (but what primary school?? They’re obviously like a young adult) And they said it’s private (?)</p>\n\n<p>Anyways they asked me how my schedules are like usually and I was so uncomfy and yes I could’ve just left or stood my ground but I don’t do well in situations like that so I just told them I end late usually</p>\n\n<p>Then they suddenly asked if we could meet this weekend? Though I already told them I’m not free till next year literally </p>\n\n<p>They asked to exchange contact and I didn’t really want to but they asked a few more times and again I’m not good at rejecting people at all so I gave them my WhatsApp </p>\n\n<p>They sent me their name and it’s a name of guys and I thought the whole time I was talking to a tomboy / butch / lesbian but they might be a guy? And that immediately changed how I felt about this, because I was already weirded out even if they’re a girl or so I assumed, but they might be a guy(?)</p>\n\n<p>Anyways am I the one tripping here and feeling weird and uneasy about this interaction? I’m kinda scared rn maybe because it’s midnight and I’m overthinking and they could’ve just been super friendly and telling the truth but I’m scared for some reasons LOL </p>\n\n<p>edit: I forgot to mention that luckily after this they haven’t messaged me yet (except their name on the spot) nor added me to any groups… actually tbfh idk why tf I gave my number but I didn���t even know how to walk away back then helps</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Most of us would have been disciplined using physical methods by our parents and unlike the West we don&#39;t really consider it to be abuse.</p>\n\n<p>My view is that it&#39;s never okay to hurt a child- but the only context I see myself doing it is if my kid purposely hurts others - in which case I feel that it&#39;s somewhat ok to hit lightly on the arm or legs to let them know if you hurt others you&#39;ll get hurt too. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately my ex who I share custody with recently slapped my 2 year old on the face - not super hard but enough to scare her and make her cry and her face was a lil red - for hurting an older cousin unprovoked. To be fair he doesn&#39;t think what he did was right and feels extremely guilty about it, and claims that it was an instinctual reaction which I believe to a large extent as i know he can&#39;t fake remorse. We did have a huge argument after kiddo went to sleep and we agreed this will never happen again. But am I taking it too easy here? Should I be taking steps to allow him to never be alone with her? </p>\n\n<p>He does have an anger issue but it has almost always been exclusive to me. I can tell he loves our kid more than anyone else and though they don&#39;t spend the most time together he is extremely patient with her, more than I have ever been.</p>\n\n<p>When looking at other subreddits and forums the comments are always &quot;he&#39;s a child abuser monster report him to cps etc.&quot; but I want to know from fellow Singaporeans/Asians is a one-off thing acceptable? </p>\n\n<p>My own opinion and threshold is very subjective as I was also slapped around as a kid and during our marriage so i don&#39;t trust my judgement. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello everyone, Just a tourist here to your wonderful country. While I&#39;m mostly in awe of everything there and have nothing but great things to say about my recent trip to Singapore, I was left a little dismayed by the huge number of rats in birds paradise at Mandai. They&#39;re so numerous that they don&#39;t even try to hide and are mostly just roaming around in the open with no fear. I observed them fighting, mating, eating and even chasing away some beautiful and I presume rare birds and steal their food. Several birds especially the ground dwellers constantly keep chasing them away and seemed quite stressed.</p>\n\n<p>And these rats are climbing the trees to create more nuisance for the poor nesting birds. I saw a poor nicobar pigeon fighting with one rat as it had come too close to its nest. </p>\n\n<p>I did notice several rat traps but most if not all were empty and the rats seemed to just ignore them as they get easier food all around the area. </p>\n\n<p>I had the privilege to visit the bird park at Jurong many years back and I never saw these many rats back then. What changed so drastically in the relocation to make the situation so bad? One elder gentleman joked that it seems to be a paradise alright but mostly for the rats! It was a bit disheartening to hear as it&#39;s such a wonderful attraction and I do believe it&#39;s better than the Jurong bird park in so many ways. </p>\n\n<p>I just hope the fantastic and dedicated people at Birds paradise can find a proper solution to this menace and make the experience better.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
