I&#39;m a currently a student living in the England, in search of my Grandmothers Singaporean family whom she lost contact with after leaving the country. I previously attempted to find them without success, but after her recent, unfortunate passing, I feel more motivated to find them then ever before.  </p>\n\n<p>My Grandma was <strong>born in Singapore, 7th February 1944, around the Sembawang area</strong>. Shortly after she was born, she was adopted into the De Souza family (who I am looking for). The De Souza&#39;s, of Eurasian Descent-a mix of Chinese, Malaysian and Portuguese origin, consisted of her <strong>Mother- Agnes De Souza, Father- Edmond De Souza, Sister- Susan De Souza (later married Susan Chan but now believed to be divorced) and Brothers- Fredrick, William and Patrick De Souza</strong>. They were an extremely religious family, prominent Catholics, who regularly attended Church. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have their exact, prior addresses, however <strong>I do know they had lived in Sembawang, and Queenstown (possibly near Commonwealth Drive)</strong>. My grandma attended a convent school, St Marys-however I have been unable to find anything on this, it may be incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>In 1972, after the birth of my eldest uncle, she left Singapore with my Grandad and came to England. My Grandad and her had married in October, 1970. Her last address in Singapore, on my their Marriage certificate is <strong>9, Burma Road, Singapore 8</strong>. I also know she had a friend named <strong>Dora Suares</strong> and another, <strong>Henry Lesslar Robert</strong>. Sadly, due to Singapore changing so much over the years, she lost contact with all of them. Since leaving, she only returned to Singapore once in the early 2000s, however she was unable to locate any of them. Any information, or ideas into how I could locate them would be greatly appreciated. I have some photos of my Grandma and her family, but it won&#39;t let me attach them. If you would like to see them just let me know and I can send them to you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Lately there’s smoke everywhere, and it’s almost always middle-aged chinese uncle, just strolling around with lit cigarettes, even smoking in void decks. </p>\n\n<p>You literally can’t say anything to them, and the government isn’t doing anything as I keep complaining with evidence about it, and at the end of the day they send me some of the pics of my void deck and said the thing has been “settled” what a biggest joke I have ever heard! never felt this annoyed with it for so many years, but now every time I go out if my house, I’m bound to run into secondhand smoke even if it’s not even a designated smoking area.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you smoke or not pls la just be a considerate person, as if you smoke, please make sure it doesn’t affect anyone else.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
