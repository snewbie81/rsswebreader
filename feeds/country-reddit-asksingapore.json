He alleged that the bill was 3k and he (uni student) and his brother had struggled to pay off 2k and they are lacking $1.2k. </p>\n\n<p>Many kind redditors have offered to help with the medical bills and he has dmed us an image of the kitten in treatment and a legitimate itemised invoice from the vet. However the invoice date has been conveniently removed. I called up the vet to check with the customer ID and that kitten was admitted in 2023 and has not been back since. Also have checked OP’s other comments, said that he is a married guy who moved into his own house at 25 and could save for renovations honeymoon etc. So obviously a scam.</p>\n\n<p>In his post he has updated that he received $200 from donations. I don’t know who you kind but gullible souls are, but if you are one of them please make a police report. I have his name and contact details if you require them. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I’ve sent a lost and found enquiry to Changi Airport and they said it takes a week to resolve the issue. \nMy concern here is that by the time the 1 week is up, the AirPods would have run out of battery and I won’t be able to track. </p>\n\n<p>The last seen location is in Changi Airport Terminal 1, Arrival Cres. </p>\n\n<p>If anyone comes across an AirPods Pro named Jo’s AirPods Pro, please send me a message with the picture of it. \nIt has a sky blue casing &amp; black hook on the side. The AirPods is full of scratches inside. \nWill give a small reward once the item has been returned to me. </p>\n\n<p>Also, would appreciate it if anyone has come across such situations to provide me with some advise. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you so much in advance. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Would it not have been more beneficial to omit one of the stations, and build it closer to Jurong West street 42 before making the turn towards Tengah? Was just curious, would appreciate any insights</p>\n\n<p>b) Similar question with regards to the branch going towards NTU, would it not have been possible to have another station after Gek Poh at somewhere near Jurong West avenue 5/pioneer road north? </p>\n\n<p>Appreciate all insights! Thanks</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
