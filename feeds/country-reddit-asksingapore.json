      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>My brother has landed himself and my dad in absolute deep shit and I have been stressing out over this matter.</p>\n\n<p>He took a student loan back in 2021 to further his studies. Upon graduation he had his own business but it hasn’t been making profits the past few months. I highly believe this is the reason he hasn’t been making his student loan payments. It is now 2 months overdue and he has to make payment for this month too. Total amount is $1800. And it is already end of the month which means he is due to make a total payment of $2400 to the bank. The $2400 is the total amount from September to December as his loan is due at the start of the month. </p>\n\n<p>I normally don’t open his letters but a legal letter came under his name and I had a feeling that it was about his student loan, and I was unfortunately right. If I had not opened the letter, I would not have found out that he has been served a legal letter to pay the bank the remaining of his student loan in full. The amount is $21K and he definitely does not have that kind of money and neither do me or my parents. My dad is a grab driver and my mum is a SAHM so the only ones contributing financially to the household are my dad and I.</p>\n\n<p>After reading the letter, I went to check his email on his iPad and found an email from the OCBC Collections Group Risk Management which requested him to give them a call by 2nd December otherwise they will assign his case to their law firm to commence legal action.</p>\n\n<p>However he already got a legal letter and it states that unless the total sum of $21K as well as all interest and other fees/charges which continue to accrue up to the date of full payment are paid to our clients within three (3) days from the date hereof, they have OCBC’s firm instructions to commence legal proceedings against him for the recovery of all outstanding sums without further notice. The letter also states that that information regarding his credit conduct shall be disclosed to the Credit Bureau Singapore.</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure what to do now as the guarantor of his student loan is out dad and I am sure my dad has no idea of this as I just checked the joint student loan account on his OCBC app and the number has been changed from my dad’s to my brother’s business number. </p>\n\n<p>I know covering for him is bad but I don’t want my dad’s credit to be affected. My dad went bankrupt 16 years ago and it took years for him to clear his credit and turn his life around. I don’t wish for my brother or my dad to declare bankruptcy over this.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know if we can request for OCBC to take back the legal letter if my brother pays for the 4 months of payment in full? If it’s $2400 that they want now, that is a much doable amount for us than $21K in full. </p>\n\n<p>Any advice is appreciated. Thank you in advance. </p>\n\n<p>—————————</p>\n\n<p>Add on:\nThank you all for the advice and tips. I will be discussing this matter with both my dad and brother the moment both of them are home. I will be making sure that he calls the bank tomorrow morning and negotiate if he’s able to make monthly installments again if I help him cover the $2400 this one time.</p>\n\n<p>For those asking and wondering why we don’t have any savings as a family, my dad lost $30-40K to a scam that he was roped into by my uncle. We have reported this to the police months ago but there has been very little progress to the case. My dad is a grab driver while my mum is a SAHM. Aside from my dad working, I’m the only other one working full time while my brother (the one who got us into this mess) has been losing profits in a business that he started. We have another sibling that’s younger than both of us but he’s just a secondary school student.</p>\n\n<p>My brother’s loan payment is $600 a month and he’s been missing payments since September. From what I know, he has to make payment before the start of each month, so payment for December has to be made by end of November otherwise late fees will occur after the 10th of December. So from September to December, he will have to pay $2400 if the bank allows us to get him back on track for monthly installments again. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

She asked me if i was going to work tomorrow, i said no, and she told me to tell the hr who hired me. I have texted hr, but hasn&#39;t received a reply. I also did not go for work. The contract says that we needed to give notice of 1 week before, or pay the salary in lieu of notice period. </p>\n\n<p>Is it possible that they may let me go immediately without any consequences?
