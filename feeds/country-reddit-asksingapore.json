      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi, I’m a Singaporean, and I’ve been working in pastries and baking for about 9 years. In almost every kitchen I’ve worked in, around 95% of my colleagues were Malaysian or Myanmar workers, with very few locals if not just PRs. Many of them often ask about my salary and compare life here, saying I’m “lucky” as a Singaporean, even though I also struggle financially and pay my own bills like anyone else.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, some share that they came here young, even under 18, through agents or under-the-table arrangements by forging fake passort. I’ve also been bullied during my internship by malaysian seniors and was even backstabbed then got fired without knowing why, though I want to acknowledge that not all foreigners colleagues are like that, and I have met good ones too.</p>\n\n<p>Still, their constant comparisons sometimes make me feel like a stranger in my own country, like more of an enterprise I’m trying to survive in, rather than a home. I rarely voice these feelings, but after holding them in for so long, I find myself snapping more easily. Jobs are harder to get now in f&amp;b with those talented PRs and foreginers and company cheat with quotas. I’m beginning to feel isolated and annoyed every time comparison comes up.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not sure how to label this feelings.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Left after scholarship bond finished as I felt I was not growing and learning in my job anymore.</p>\n\n<p>I have since transitioned to private sector (senior marketing exec in automotive industry) for the past 6 months and am struggling with the transition. I am not sure if it is just my current boss&#39;s behavior or if this is common throughout private sector.</p>\n\n<p>My current boss who was my hiring manager when I secured this role got promoted to a director level position and told me that the manager position she was initially at would be left empty for me to prove myself and get promoted to. She shared that there would be no definitely timeline she can commit to. I did feel she might just be baiting me to work super hard but I wanted to prove myself to her.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, I have been feeling severely overworked as my boss seems to be a workaholic who would message me on teams even when I am on leave and end up scolding me if I do not reply timely. The amount of workload I am having to handle causes me to be working even when I go back home. I literally eat dinner at home while working on my work laptop.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, I chose endure as I was the one who wanted the jump from public sector to private sector. I also believed that I had to manage my expectations since this was private sector which was far more cutthroat and profit driven. However, I subsequently learned that besides my predecessor who quit due to burnout, two others have also left the team due to the workload. Their replacements who joined later than me have all shared how toxic our boss is and how she does not respect our boundaries at all even if we are on leave or on MC.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, I felt infuriated when I learnt that she doesn&#39;t read any emails she is cc-ed on. I wrote her a very detailed HOTO email on the tasks I was handing over to her and even had a call with her about it. She listened to everything but still kept pinging me during my holiday even though I was in a different timezone. It felt worse when she was reaching out to me constantly for information which was clearly stated in the email.</p>\n\n<p>Is this a common occurrence in private sector? Do senior bosses not even care about their emails due to the sheer number of emails they get cc-ed in? Do people in private sector ever manage to protect their own time while ensuring they dont end up getting fired?</p>\n\n<p>Definitely appreciate any advice, hopefully from manager/director level individuals in private sector. Would welcome any other comments too. How would you deal with the situation I am in without just quitting?</p>\n\n<p><em>PS I do sometimes regret quitting civil service as it provided far more job security, but I am learning so much more in this current role which gives me job satisfaction. I am just worried my boss&#39;s mood and temper will one day cause me to be unemployed even though the whole team is struggling and dying. With the existing job market, I do not want to quit and find another role without giving this job a few years at least. I am just worried that I might get fired by then.</em></p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance for any tips or advice in this matter.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
