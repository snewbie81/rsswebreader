Young girls, young men, older men… every second person would smile at my baby, nudge their friends to look and even stop to say hello. This was really sweet and heartfelt. The downside to this was that I caught a ridiculous amount of people filming/photographing my baby without my consent. This made me feel so uncomfortable but often was sadly out of my control. Quite a few people asked if they could take a photo, to which I respectfully declined. </p>\n\n<p>I am curious to know if this is standard in Singapore when it comes to babies?

I&#39;m a currently a student living in the England, in search of my Grandmothers Singaporean family whom she lost contact with after leaving the country. I previously attempted to find them without success, but after her recent, unfortunate passing, I feel more motivated to find them then ever before.  </p>\n\n<p>My Grandma was <strong>born in Singapore, 7th February 1944, around the Sembawang area</strong>. Shortly after she was born, she was adopted into the De Souza family (who I am looking for). The De Souza&#39;s, of Eurasian Descent-a mix of Chinese, Malaysian and Portuguese origin, consisted of her <strong>Mother- Agnes De Souza, Father- Edmond De Souza, Sister- Susan De Souza (later married Susan Chan but now believed to be divorced) and Brothers- Fredrick, William and Patrick De Souza</strong>. They were an extremely religious family, prominent Catholics, who regularly attended Church. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have their exact, prior addresses, however <strong>I do know they had lived in Sembawang, and Queenstown (possibly near Commonwealth Drive)</strong>. My grandma attended a convent school, St Marys-however I have been unable to find anything on this, it may be incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>In 1972, after the birth of my eldest uncle, she left Singapore with my Grandad and came to England. My Grandad and her had married in October, 1970. Her last address in Singapore, on my their Marriage certificate is <strong>9, Burma Road, Singapore 8</strong>. I also know she had a friend named <strong>Dora Suares</strong> and another, <strong>Henry Lesslar Robert</strong>. Sadly, due to Singapore changing so much over the years, she lost contact with all of them. Since leaving, she only returned to Singapore once in the early 2000s, however she was unable to locate any of them. Any information, or ideas into how I could locate them would be greatly appreciated. I have some photos of my Grandma and her family, but it won&#39;t let me attach them. If you would like to see them just let me know and I can send them to you.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

We got an “immediate attention” letter because of late rent and yet he still doesn’t want to pay for it, in fact, when my mom told him about it, he said “not my problem”. </p>\n\n<p>He also used to smoke cigarettes in the balcony but now, he smokes cigarettes INSIDE THE BEDROOM, where everyone sleeps as well. So we have to constantly sleep in a room with the smoking smell.</p>\n\n<p>Not only did he do those things, he also STOLE MONEY from me and my sister. We usually keep money in a piggybank but then money started disappearing and it was clear who had it. Idk how much he has taken from my sister but he stole about $300 from me before i realised.</p>\n\n<p>Im scared of what may happen in the near future so im finally asking, what can I do.

I realised later that the market rate for such role is mid 3 to high 4. I have verbally accepted the offer but yet to sign. Is it possible for me to ask for mid 3 now?
