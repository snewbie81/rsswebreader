He (M) just got his BTO recently, and his wife’s parents suggested to let her elder brother (mid 30s, non local), to stay in their house, say can take care of each other. Maybe will give small token as rental payment (?) </p>\n\n<p>He’s asking how we as friends think of this. Of course, he prefers to have personal space with his wife, but his wife is trying to persuade him to go with this arrangement. </p>\n\n<p>The problem is his brother in law is earning quite decently, possibly double my friend’s salary. But the brother in law don’t really feel paiseh or anything and just happy with the proposal. </p>\n\n<p>Personally I don’t mind in law to stay for a week or so but not for months or years. But I don’t have good advice for his situation as he is not sure how his wife will react if he insists with no! So just wondering if this is common? Anyone stay with your in law and how is it?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
