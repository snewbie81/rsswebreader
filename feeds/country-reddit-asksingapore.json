My memory is already failing me but they started telling me how they’re not local and have this ��community” where they do everything together — exercising on the weekends, hiking, and talking about religions (this made me skeptical immediately)</p>\n\n<p>Halfway through the convo they started speaking in Chinese instead and I think I didn’t know how to react once I heard the word religious study… I wanted to reject immediately but they didn’t really give me a chance to talk and asked me questions instead… like many questions that I felt weird about. I’m all for talking to strangers in public especially the girlies (bc I’m a girl) but this person gave me weird vibes…. They asked me if I live around here and I said no… then I supplemented with more info like why I was there. Then they asked me if I’m working? If I’m learning Japanese? And then I said yes my test is soon… then they ask me about my motivations to study this and what’s my religion?? immediately my gut feeling was signalling to me and I was thinking “is this a cult recruitment?”</p>\n\n<p>Then I asked back but they didn’t give me a straightforward answer. I asked if they’re a student here and they said yes for 6 months, to learn English. I asked, in Uni? And they said no, primary school (this was in Chinese). I really couldn’t understand it feels like they’re making stuff up on the spot and I asked primary school?? (They said this in Chinese so i didn’t mishear since it’s their mother tongue) (but what primary school?? They’re obviously like a young adult) And they said it’s private (?)</p>\n\n<p>Anyways they asked me how my schedules are like usually and I was so uncomfy and yes I could’ve just left or stood my ground but I don’t do well in situations like that so I just told them I end late usually</p>\n\n<p>Then they suddenly asked if we could meet this weekend? Though I already told them I’m not free till next year literally </p>\n\n<p>They asked to exchange contact and I didn’t really want to but they asked a few more times and again I’m not good at rejecting people at all so I gave them my WhatsApp </p>\n\n<p>They sent me their name and it’s a name of guys and I thought the whole time I was talking to a tomboy / butch / lesbian but they might be a guy? And that immediately changed how I felt about this, because I was already weirded out even if they’re a girl or so I assumed, but they might be a guy(?)</p>\n\n<p>Anyways am I the one tripping here and feeling weird and uneasy about this interaction? I’m kinda scared rn maybe because it’s midnight and I’m overthinking and they could’ve just been super friendly and telling the truth but I’m scared for some reasons LOL </p>\n\n<p>edit: I forgot to mention that luckily after this they haven’t messaged me yet (except their name on the spot) nor added me to any groups… actually tbfh idk why tf I gave my number but I didn’t even know how to walk away back then helps</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I will be filing a police report, but I want to understand what usually happens in cases like this.</p>\n\n<p>I had a close friend for more than eight years. Because I am always busy with work, I have asked him before to help me sell high value items. He has sold other items for me on Carousell in the past, handled buyers, and I always gave him a small cut for helping. There were never any issues even with items worth a few thousand dollars, so I had full trust in him. That is why I was comfortable letting him handle something as valuable as a 10k watch.</p>\n\n<p>This time everything went wrong. I asked him to help me sell the watch. He sold it, but he hid it from me. He kept the money and used it to gamble on illegal online sites. He lost all of it. I only found out after confronting him and he admitted it.</p>\n\n<p>I also know he is not someone who can realistically pay the money back. He has no job, no stability, no discipline, and no education. He has never shown the ability to work consistently. So I know that expecting him to repay through work or effort is not realistic. That is part of why I have decided to take the legal route.</p>\n\n<p>For anyone who has gone through something similar or knows how these cases usually turn out, what realistically happens after filing a report. How long does the investigation take. Do people usually get fines, short jail time, or something else for a first offence. Were you able to recover any money. How did the process go overall.</p>\n\n<p>I am not expecting the money back. I just want justice and some clarity, because this was someone I trusted like family.</p>\n\n<p>Any insight would help.</p>\n\n<p><em>EDIT</em></p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your responses. Some people are suggesting the small claims tribunal, but my understanding is that this situation involves him selling my property without my knowledge, taking the money, and using it on illegal gambling. To me this sounds more like a criminal act rather than a civil claim. If I am misunderstanding this or if there is a reason small claims applies here, please correct me.</p>\n\n<p><em>EDIT 2</em></p>\n\n<p>Part 2 with more information is up on my page. Thank you for all your responses.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
