Recently I had the opportunity to meet my Singaporean colleagues face-to-face for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>They were all nice and very welcoming towards me, but what I found weird was that quite often they switched to Chinese very randomly in the middle of a conversation. This happened many times every day and both in work related discussions and during the meals. Like there were me and 3 Singaporean colleagues sharing a table and out of sudden they all just switched to Chinese. At some point they always switched back to English but never explained why or what they needed to chat in Chinese. </p>\n\n<p>I find it quite rude and awkward at the same time. Is this something usual in Singapore or should I take it personally?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Young girls, young men, older men… every second person would smile at my baby, nudge their friends to look and even stop to say hello. This was really sweet and heartfelt. The downside to this was that I caught a ridiculous amount of people filming/photographing my baby without my consent. This made me feel so uncomfortable but often was sadly out of my control. Quite a few people asked if they could take a photo, to which I respectfully declined. </p>\n\n<p>I am curious to know if this is standard in Singapore when it comes to babies? This isn’t really the norm where I come from, especially taking photos/filming without consent. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
