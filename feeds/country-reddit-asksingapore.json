For those who did not know, it was a guy pretending to have saved a kitten who needs urgent treatment including blood transfusions. He alleged that the bill was 3k and he (uni student) and his brother had struggled to pay off 2k and they are lacking $1.2k. </p>\n\n<p>Many kind redditors have offered to help with the medical bills and he has dmed us an image of the kitten in treatment and a legitimate itemised invoice from the vet. However the invoice date has been conveniently removed. I called up the vet to check with the customer ID and that kitten was admitted in 2023 and has not been back since. Also have checked OP’s other comments, said that he is a married guy who moved into his own house at 25 and could save for renovations honeymoon etc. So obviously a scam.</p>\n\n<p>In his post he has updated that he received $200 from donations. I don’t know who you kind but gullible souls are, but if you are one of them please make a police report. I have his name and contact details if you require them. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Suddenly, someone was trying to talk to me and I thought they wanted to browse where I am so I moved my stuff and said sorry. </p>\n\n<p>They asked if I had a min so I took out my AirPods. My memory is already failing me but they started telling me how they’re not local and have this “community” where they do everything together — exercising on the weekends, hiking, and talking about religions (this made me skeptical immediately)</p>\n\n<p>Halfway through the convo they started speaking in Chinese instead and I think I didn’t know how to react once I heard the word religious study… I wanted to reject immediately but they didn’t really give me a chance to talk and asked me questions instead… like many questions that I felt weird about. I’m all for talking to strangers in public especially the girlies (bc I’m a girl) but this person gave me weird vibes…. They asked me if I live around here and I said no… then I supplemented with more info like why I was there. Then they asked me if I’m working? If I’m learning Japanese? And then I said yes my test is soon… then they ask me about my motivations to study this and what’s my religion?? immediately my gut feeling was signalling to me and I was thinking “is this a cult recruitment?”</p>\n\n<p>Then I asked back but they didn’t give me a straightforward answer. I asked if they’re a student here and they said yes for 6 months, to learn English. I asked, in Uni? And they said no, primary school (this was in Chinese). I really couldn’t understand it feels like they’re making stuff up on the spot and I asked primary school?? (They said this in Chinese so i didn’t mishear since it’s their mother tongue) (but what primary school?? They’re obviously like a young adult) And they said it’s private (?)</p>\n\n<p>Anyways they asked me how my schedules are like usually and I was so uncomfy and yes I could’ve just left or stood my ground but I don’t do well in situations like that so I just told them I end late usually</p>\n\n<p>Then they suddenly asked if we could meet this weekend? Though I already told them I’m not free till next year literally </p>\n\n<p>They asked to exchange contact and I didn’t really want to but they asked a few more times and again I’m not good at rejecting people at all so I gave them my WhatsApp </p>\n\n<p>They sent me their name and it’s a name of guys and I thought the whole time I was talking to a tomboy / butch / lesbian but they might be a guy? And that immediately changed how I felt about this, because I was already weirded out even if they’re a girl or so I assumed, but they might be a guy(?)</p>\n\n<p>Anyways am I the one tripping here and feeling weird and uneasy about this interaction? I’m kinda scared rn maybe because it’s midnight and I’m overthinking and they could’ve just been super friendly and telling the truth but I’m scared for some reasons LOL </p>\n\n<p>edit: I forgot to mention that luckily after this they haven’t messaged me yet (except their name on the spot) nor added me to any groups… actually tbfh idk why tf I gave my number but I didn’t even know how to walk away back then helps</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Most of us would have been disciplined using physical methods by our parents and unlike the West we don&#39;t really consider it to be abuse.</p>\n\n<p>My view is that it&#39;s never okay to hurt a child- but the only context I see myself doing it is if my kid purposely hurts others - in which case I feel that it&#39;s somewhat ok to hit lightly on the arm or legs to let them know if you hurt others you&#39;ll get hurt too. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately my ex who I share custody with recently slapped my 2 year old on the face - not super hard but enough to scare her and make her cry and her face was a lil red - for hurting an older cousin unprovoked. To be fair he doesn&#39;t think what he did was right and feels extremely guilty about it, and claims that it was an instinctual reaction which I believe to a large extent as i know he can&#39;t fake remorse. We did have a huge argument after kiddo went to sleep and we agreed this will never happen again. But am I taking it too easy here? Should I be taking steps to allow him to never be alone with her? </p>\n\n<p>He does have an anger issue but it has almost always been exclusive to me.

When I bought my TV, I didn&#39;t realise they were basically dropshippers, so given the price point, why not. Never again after this experience.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve had it for just over 3 years. The warranty ran out earlier this year.   </p>\n\n<p>My housemate wanted to charge his Switch at the stand at the TV console, it has 3 sockets side by side. The first socket is a power strip. The second socket is the TV, and the third is the Internet modem + Router.  </p>\n\n<p>He turned on the TV, it was working. He plugged the Switch stand into the power strip, and it tripped just one switch in the circuit breaker. Everything else was still working. For reference, we charge the Switch in that position all the time and there weren&#39;t any new devices plugged in, so it couldn&#39;t have been us using too much power.</p>\n\n<p>According to my housemate, the TV was still on when I flipped the switch up. I can&#39;t confirm though. The screen was black since the source was the Switch, which was not on.   </p>\n\n<p>The moment I flipped the circuit breaker switch, the power strip turned on but the TV died. Even when we switched sockets and used an extension from another working socket to plug it in, it wouldn&#39;t turn on, so it&#39;s most likely the TV  </p>\n\n<p>I contacted Prism+ support and they asked me for a video. I sent one simply showing that the TV wouldn&#39;t turn on using the remote. </p>\n\n<p>Based on that, their response was that the TV was damaged beyond &quot;economical repair&quot; and since my warranty has run out, the best course of action was to buy another TV and they would give me a special $50 discount that would stack with that on the site.</p>\n\n<p>Kind of blew my mind. They didn&#39;t even want to send someone down to take a look and wanted me to buy another $2k+ TV with an almost insulting $50 voucher.   </p>\n\n<p>Given the sequence of events, I feel it might be the power board, but not sure if getting it replaced is really &quot;beyond economical repair&quot;. Wondering if anyone else has experienced a similar issue with their Prism TV dying and what fixed it? </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
