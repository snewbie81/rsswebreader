He alleged that the bill was 3k and he (uni student) and his brother had struggled to pay off 2k and they are lacking $1.2k. </p>\n\n<p>Many kind redditors have offered to help with the medical bills and he has dmed us an image of the kitten in treatment and a legitimate itemised invoice from the vet. However the invoice date has been conveniently removed. I called up the vet to check with the customer ID and that kitten was admitted in 2023 and has not been back since. Also have checked OP’s other comments, said that he is a married guy who moved into his own house at 25 and could save for renovations honeymoon etc. So obviously a scam.</p>\n\n<p>In his post he has updated that he received $200 from donations.

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Just had a young foreign lady come to my door, asking if I could help her with $10 to top-up her Ez-Link card as she ran out of money.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve seen others talking about being approached at MRT stations and the conclusion were those were scams. This one seems to be taking it to the next level though, I live on a high floor in the neighborhood areas and it makes completely no sense for a stranger i&#39;ve never seen before to be on my floor knocking on my door asking for money to top-up card.</p>\n\n<p>Before I came out of my room, she was calling out &quot;Aunty, aunty&quot; at my gate to get attention, and she was surprised to see a relatively young person come out of the room instead. The whole feel and timing (weekday day-time), makes it feel like she&#39;s targetting old people who are home at this time and might not know better. Something to give your elderly parents a heads up about!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
