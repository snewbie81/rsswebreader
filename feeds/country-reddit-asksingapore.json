      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi, I made a previous post and it got deleted cos i didnt go indepth (i think) 2so I was a shut-in/jobless for 5 years. </p>\n\n<p>First job ever pay was really bad. 2.2k with very tiresome/unpleasant manager to work with. Did checks on the staff like every 30mins to 1 hour to see if we were slacking off. Sometimes need to work ot on saturday too but no ot pay/can&#39;t claim time off. Standard 9 to 6 mon-fri. Managed to survive for 1 year, then I quit ofc.</p>\n\n<p>Second job, the one I&#39;m on my second year at, earning about 3k. Boss is chill, work hour 9 to 5 \n mon-fri, inclusive of 1 hr lunch break, so it&#39;s 7 hours work. Leave 5 to 10 mins early off work and come 5 to 10mins late the boss dont mind. Rarely need to ot, no ot pay but this boss allow time off claims. </p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the tricky part. I dont have much work exp, only 2 years, early into 3rd year, but from my prev job, this 1 is a lot better from my prev job. Honestly though, I dont see long term career prospect going long term in this job but its very chill and this boss is definitely an outlier and not easy to find, comparing to whatever I&#39;ve read online about ppls experiences+prev boss.</p>\n\n<p>Frankly speaking, job wise im happy as of now. Ok la I earn little i know, but job is not that stressful and hours chill. My hobby is video games after work got time for it. Might sound rly hard to believe, I used to to be overweight but during that 5 years i actually lost weight until i become &quot;skinny&quot; according to my parents. Diet for 5 years was plain bread for breakfast and whatever they cook for dinner. Learned how to appreciate simple food. Even now when working, my lifestyle still remain the same so im a low spender and what I earn is more than enough for me even after I give 1k to my parents, still can save a decent bit after. Exercise daily to stay in shape, everyday just pump 160 pushup situp and some squat lunge at home, 20-30mins settled no need go gym.</p>\n\n<p>But heres the part where I dont feel happy. Naturally im introverted and shy, I dont make friends easily and whatever i had i cut everyone off when i shutin for 5 years, i deleted all my social media. Rly want friends cos sometimes i like to go to anime/game convention/exhibitions go alone is v awkward + not as fun. But in general\ngot a few friends is good la... now i feel quite lonely and alone sometimes and thinking about it always make me gloomy. </p>\n\n<p>So, tldr, after all that, shld I &quot;better&quot; myself go unskilled pursue part time degree etc etc so maybe ppl want to associate themselves with me, so that i can find friends/companionship? I dont like to associate w  my cousins and their family cos they all look down on me cos I earn v little compared to them but idgaf what they think leh...</p>\n\n<p>Sry for long post</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Didn&#39;t have a good feel for the company culture from the start, but it was and still is a good learning opportunity so I decided to give it a try.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to today, my team is nice enough but I won&#39;t say we are close, and everyone is very sian. Work is never ending and it only gets more. As work increases, I start to make small mistakes here and there, but every time this happens it&#39;s magnified and put on blast.</p>\n\n<p>I feel okay about what I do - don&#39;t hate it, can be good at it, but also not that I love it. I would much prefer doing this in a different environment though.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been thinking about quitting without another job lined up despite the bad market, just so I can take a break and travel for a bit while I&#39;m still young - no financial committments right now.</p>\n\n<p>I know the conventional advice is to do the bare minimum and look for a job while still employed but honestly? It&#39;s so tough logistically and mentally. Even the &quot;bare minimum&quot; expectations is enough that I need to OT extra 1-2 hours everyday with the occasional weekend, I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m in the right headspace for a job hunt in the remaining time.</p>\n\n<p>That said, part of me also wonders if I should just suck it up for another year, work on improving my own performance and get better at what I do before moving.

Last time that I went was in 2024, it was nicely decorated and set up and cool sets and lights...but strangely empty. It was like a ghost town that time when I went. They have stage activities and all, no many audience or crowd. At both food stalls and vendors stall, it was all empty, making me think something is wrong with the event itself. </p>\n\n<p>I wonder how a badly run local event survived this long? How was your experience there? What went wrong?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
