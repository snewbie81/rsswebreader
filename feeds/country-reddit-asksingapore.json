      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi, I made a previous post and it got deleted cos i didnt go indepth (i think) 2so I was a shut-in/jobless for 5 years. </p>\n\n<p>First job ever pay was really bad. 2.2k with very tiresome/unpleasant manager to work with. Did checks on the staff like every 30mins to 1 hour to see if we were slacking off. Sometimes need to work ot on saturday too but no ot pay/can&#39;t claim time off. Standard 9 to 6 mon-fri. Managed to survive for 1 year, then I quit ofc.</p>\n\n<p>Second job, the one I&#39;m on my second year at, earning about 3k. Boss is chill, work hour 9 to 5 \n mon-fri, inclusive of 1 hr lunch break, so it&#39;s 7 hours work. Leave 5 to 10 mins early off work and come 5 to 10mins late the boss dont mind. Rarely need to ot, no ot pay but this boss allow time off claims. </p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the tricky part. I dont have much work exp, only 2 years, early into 3rd year, but from my prev job, this 1 is a lot better from my prev job. Honestly though, I dont see long term career prospect going long term in this job but its very chill and this boss is definitely an outlier and not easy to find, comparing to whatever I&#39;ve read online about ppls experiences+prev boss.</p>\n\n<p>Frankly speaking, job wise im happy as of now. Ok la I earn little i know, but job is not that stressful and hours chill. My hobby is video games after work got time for it. Might sound rly hard to believe, I used to to be overweight but during that 5 years i actually lost weight until i become &quot;skinny&quot; according to my parents. Diet for 5 years was plain bread for breakfast and whatever they cook for dinner. Learned how to appreciate simple food. Even now when working, my lifestyle still remain the same so im a low spender and what I earn is more than enough for me even after I give 1k to my parents, still can save a decent bit after. Exercise daily to stay in shape, everyday just pump 160 pushup situp and some squat lunge at home, 20-30mins settled no need go gym.</p>\n\n<p>But heres the part where I dont feel happy. Naturally im introverted and shy, I dont make friends easily and whatever i had i cut everyone off when i shutin for 5 years, i deleted all my social media. Rly want friends cos sometimes i like to go to anime/game convention/exhibitions go alone is v awkward + not as fun. But in general\ngot a few friends is good la... now i feel quite lonely and alone sometimes and thinking about it always make me gloomy. </p>\n\n<p>So, tldr, after all that, shld I &quot;better&quot; myself go unskilled pursue part time degree etc etc so maybe ppl want to associate themselves with me, so that i can find friends/companionship? I dont like to associate w  my cousins and their family cos they all look down on me cos I earn v little compared to them but idgaf what they think leh...</p>\n\n<p>Sry for long post</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Didn&#39;t have a good feel for the company culture from the start, but it was and still is a good learning opportunity so I decided to give it a try.</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to today, my team is nice enough but I won&#39;t say we are close, and everyone is very sian. Work is never ending and it only gets more. As work increases, I start to make small mistakes here and there, but every time this happens it&#39;s magnified and put on blast.</p>\n\n<p>I feel okay about what I do - don&#39;t hate it, can be good at it, but also not that I love it. I would much prefer doing this in a different environment though.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been thinking about quitting without another job lined up despite the bad market, just so I can take a break and travel for a bit while I&#39;m still young - no financial committments right now.</p>\n\n<p>I know the conventional advice is to do the bare minimum and look for a job while still employed but honestly? It&#39;s so tough logistically and mentally. Even the &quot;bare minimum&quot; expectations is enough that I need to OT extra 1-2 hours everyday with the occasional weekend, I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m in the right headspace for a job hunt in the remaining time.</p>\n\n<p>That said, part of me also wonders if I should just suck it up for another year, work on improving my own performance and get better at what I do before moving. Also unsure how employers will view the break in lieu of bad market.</p>\n\n<p>Any advice? :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I visited Singapore recently and really impressed intentional the city feels in its design. I’m not assuming it is perfect, so I’m really curious what locals and long-term expats think I might be missing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> With the (mostly sunny) weather, the affordable hawker stall food, the safety, the efficiency and the urban planning, Singapore feels like an amazing place to live. What downsides or realities am I not seeing? I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s a mix of humidity, high cost of living and size of the country. </p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Transit and rush hour</strong>\nI expected the kind of packed &amp; overwhelming rush hours you see in Tokyo or parts of China given the density and size of the city. Instead, everything felt calm and manageable... From what I understand, offices are spread across the country rather than concentrated in one downtown core. This seems to reduce the pressure on any single area and creates more balanced, bi-directional commuting. Since everything is about 30 minutes away, commuting felt surprisingly stress-free.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Cars</strong>\nCars seem intentionally positioned as a luxury. The licensing system means paying around ~$100K for a license just for the right to own a car, and something like a Toyota Corolla can cost $150K+. This results in fewer cars on the road, smoother traffic, and safer driving conditions. I relied on public transit and Grab, which felt cheap and convenient. It makes sense to me, even if it looks extreme at first glance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Punishment and surveillance</strong>\nFrom a Western perspective, Singapore’s punishments (like caning) and strict laws seem harsh. But as a &quot;regular&quot; person who does not plan on breaking the law, I didn’t feel personally affected. What I did notice was a complete feeling of safety as I never saw police, guns, or conflict. I saw cameras and well-lit public spaces. It felt like a place where crime is genuinely deterred, in part because of canings. </p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Housing and religion</strong>\nI was struck by the themes of respect and balance and I know these are a strange thing to pair together. Housing-wise, I think ~80% of the population live in public housing where the gov&#39;t assigns housing based on the country’s demographic mix which prevents the formation of super ethnic neighborhoods. In the west, it&#39;s super common to see neighborhoods that are predominantly one ethnic group, which this seems to &#39;solve&#39;. While I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem per se, my guess is that it helps reduce racial tensions and ensures kids grow up side by side with other groups. Religiously, I also walked past a street with a church, mosque, and temple all next to each other in Chinatown. The idea of peaceful coexistence of religions felt very intentional and I found that really thoughtful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Safety and homelessness</strong>\nI didn&#39;t see any homeless people during my visit. I did see migrant workers and people doing physically demanding jobs, but no one who appeared unhoused. Compared to many US/Canadian cities that struggle with homelessness, drug issues, and unsafe public spaces (SF, LA, NYC, Toronto etc.), Singapore felt incredibly safe. I’m not sure how homelessness is addressed behind the scenes though. Are people rehoused, supported, relocated, or managed in some other way?</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Mandatory military service</strong>\nMandatory military service seems intense from a Western standpoint, where military service is usually a last resort for people with fewer options (this is my personal opinion lol). In Singapore, it seems like a rite of passage for men - it builds fitness, discipline, brotherhood, and leadership skills (specifically the brotherhood one sticks out to me because of the loneliness epidemic, this is also coming from someone without many friends that wants stronger male role models and brothers in my life). Since the country is small, some training even happens abroad I think, which seems like a pretty unique experience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. Politics</strong>\nFrom the outside, having one dominant political party appears to create stability and allow for long-term planning. I think there&#39;s debate to be had here on whether that&#39;s good or not since China and North Korea have a single party system. I&#39;d say in US/Canada, we pride ourselves on having democracy and ability to vote... but, in practice, as of late, it really just feels we have two parties to choose from and that has its own problems. Leadership changes every four years and major projects often stall or get reversed, I can&#39;t imagine a public/private company having leadership changes that frequently and being able to make any meaningful progress. Singapore’s consistency looks like a big part of why the city functions so well.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, with the weather, food, safety, and sense of order, Singapore feels extremely livable to me. But as a visitor, I know there are things I probably missed or oversimplified. <strong>What am I missing? Why should I not try to live here (aside from cost of living)?</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

However, I might need to consider doing shift work (early morning/afternoon to midnight shift, rotating once a month).</p>\n\n<p>I am however pretty dissatisfied with my current lifestyle; I do have a few close friends that I meet 2-3 times a week at night to complain about life and rokok, but I would like to have more purpose and things to look forward to in life. No girlfriend unfortunately so that is off the table :&lt; </p>\n\n<p>Would appreciate any advice from seniors with experience navigating this quarter life crisis!</p>\n\n<p>(edit: i would like to avoid shift work, but given that i have been unemployed for a while, i’m not sure if i can afford to be choosy. </p>\n\n<p>this is for the semicon industry and the shift hours would be early morning - afternoon, afternoon - midnight, rotating once a month.</p>\n\n<p>the pros is that its really close to home (10min bike ride) but I’ll likely have to work paid OT on some weekends every month)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
