Quite impressed but I was told the machine costs 4.5k after discount ( can use climate voucher). Or if I don’t want to buy the machine, I can buy their cleaning package for 24 months at 3.2k. If I buy the machine, they will throw in some free servicing sessions. \nI feel that it’s too expensive and ask to consider. Although the salesperson tried to hardsell me, I did not budge. But this machine looks really impressive other than its bulky. Just want to ask if there are any other affordable ones in the market that I can buy. </p>\n",

I went to check all my house, bed table etc and still found nothing. Both my parent and me has never been bitten as of now but since the sofa cover been infested does that mean somehow there&#39;s a spot I might miss that is infested?? The bed bugs i found, none of them has blood but there were many of them just no blood. Im panicking since I had this issues long ago when I was a kid and now that it&#39;s happening again when im a adult, I&#39;m not sure what to do and I don&#39;t really have the money to hire a professional help. </p>\n\n<p>Sorry for my poor English, I&#39;m panicking and paranoid right now. Really need any help I can get since I&#39;m also in NS stay in right now, I can&#39;t really do much other then on the weekends. </p>\n\n<p>My sofa is wooden frame and not leather</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Therefore, we are collecting jerseys from various sports CCAs and schools! Do you have any school/club jerseys you don’t mind selling from any sports ccas! ($40-$50 for netball, $30 for others) If not, do you have friends in sports cca who dont mind selling! Will pay you a small commission per piece ($5 for netball, $3 for others) sold.” </p>\n\n<p>I replied once before, and the person asked me to gather a few uni classmates to meet him in person so he can share more. It sounded like insurance foreplay so I ignored it, but now wondering if it’s some new scam. Has anyone else encountered this? </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Just wanted to ask everyone here if this is a once off anomaly and if there are any steps we can take to protect ourselves for such fraudulent charges and activities on our banking cards in Singapore?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
