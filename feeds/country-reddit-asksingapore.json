He alleged that the bill was 3k and he (uni student) and his brother had struggled to pay off 2k and they are lacking $1.2k. </p>\n\n<p>Many kind redditors have offered to help with the medical bills and he has dmed us an image of the kitten in treatment and a legitimate itemised invoice from the vet. However the invoice date has been conveniently removed. I called up the vet to check with the customer ID and that kitten was admitted in 2023 and has not been back since. Also have checked OP’s other comments, said that he is a married guy who moved into his own house at 25 and could save for renovations honeymoon etc. So obviously a scam.</p>\n\n<p>In his post he has updated that he received $200 from donations. I don’t know who you kind but gullible souls are, but if you are one of them please make a police report. I have his name and contact details if you require them. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
