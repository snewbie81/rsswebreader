      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I visited Singapore recently and really impressed intentional the city feels in its design. I’m not assuming it is perfect, so I’m really curious what locals and long-term expats think I might be missing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> With the (mostly sunny) weather, the affordable hawker stall food, the safety, the efficiency and the urban planning, Singapore feels like an amazing place to live. What downsides or realities am I not seeing? I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s a mix of humidity, high cost of living and size of the country. </p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Transit and rush hour</strong>\nI expected the kind of packed &amp; overwhelming rush hours you see in Tokyo or parts of China given the density and size of the city. Instead, everything felt calm and manageable... From what I understand, offices are spread across the country rather than concentrated in one downtown core. This seems to reduce the pressure on any single area and creates more balanced, bi-directional commuting. Since everything is about 30 minutes away, commuting felt surprisingly stress-free.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Cars</strong>\nCars seem intentionally positioned as a luxury. The licensing system means paying around ~$100K for a license just for the right to own a car, and something like a Toyota Corolla can cost $150K+. This results in fewer cars on the road, smoother traffic, and safer driving conditions. I relied on public transit and Grab, which felt cheap and convenient. It makes sense to me, even if it looks extreme at first glance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Punishment and surveillance</strong>\nFrom a Western perspective, Singapore’s punishments (like caning) and strict laws seem harsh. But as a &quot;regular&quot; person who does not plan on breaking the law, I didn’t feel personally affected. What I did notice was a complete feeling of safety as I never saw police, guns, or conflict. I saw cameras and well-lit public spaces. It felt like a place where crime is genuinely deterred, in part because of canings. </p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Housing and religion</strong>\nI was struck by the themes of respect and balance and I know these are a strange thing to pair together. Housing-wise, I think ~80% of the population live in public housing where the gov&#39;t assigns housing based on the country’s demographic mix which prevents the formation of super ethnic neighborhoods. In the west, it&#39;s super common to see neighborhoods that are predominantly one ethnic group, which this seems to &#39;solve&#39;. While I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem per se, my guess is that it helps reduce racial tensions and ensures kids grow up side by side with other groups. Religiously, I also walked past a street with a church, mosque, and temple all next to each other in Chinatown. The idea of peaceful coexistence of religions felt very intentional and I found that really thoughtful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Safety and homelessness</strong>\nI didn&#39;t see any homeless people during my visit. I did see migrant workers and people doing physically demanding jobs, but no one who appeared unhoused. Compared to many US/Canadian cities that struggle with homelessness, drug issues, and unsafe public spaces (SF, LA, NYC, Toronto etc.), Singapore felt incredibly safe. I’m not sure how homelessness is addressed behind the scenes though. Are people rehoused, supported, relocated, or managed in some other way?</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Mandatory military service</strong>\nMandatory military service seems intense from a Western standpoint, where military service is usually a last resort for people with fewer options (this is my personal opinion lol). In Singapore, it seems like a rite of passage for men - it builds fitness, discipline, brotherhood, and leadership skills (specifically the brotherhood one sticks out to me because of the loneliness epidemic, this is also coming from someone without many friends that wants stronger male role models and brothers in my life). Since the country is small, some training even happens abroad I think, which seems like a pretty unique experience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. Politics</strong>\nFrom the outside, having one dominant political party appears to create stability and allow for long-term planning. I think there&#39;s debate to be had here on whether that&#39;s good or not since China and North Korea have a single party system. I&#39;d say in US/Canada, we pride ourselves on having democracy and ability to vote... but, in practice, as of late, it really just feels we have two parties to choose from and that has its own problems. Leadership changes every four years and major projects often stall or get reversed, I can&#39;t imagine a public/private company having leadership changes that frequently and being able to make any meaningful progress. Singapore’s consistency looks like a big part of why the city functions so well.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, with the weather, food, safety, and sense of order, Singapore feels extremely livable to me. But as a visitor, I know there are things I probably missed or oversimplified. <strong>What am I missing? Why should I not try to live here (aside from cost of living)?</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>For the past few years, my entire neighbourhood has smelled like one giant ashtray after 8pm. People smoke at the park, the void deck, and even right outside the food court. Most of these areas are supposed to be non-smoking zones, but the rules are completely ignored. </p>\n\n<p>My child was born with underdeveloped lungs and a weak heart, so the situation affects us even more. Our clothes keep picking up secondhand smoke, and we’re exposed to it every time we enter or leave the house. Because of that, my child has been having more frequent asthma attacks, trouble breathing, and just last week even coughed up blood. I had to take her to the hospital. The doctor diagnosed my child with acute bronchitis, caused by long-term exposure to secondhand smoke and clothes contaminated with thirdhand smoke. and the doctor also advised us not to hang our clothes outside and to keep the windows closed. But we are a low-income family, the elderly at home already have health issues that are expensive to manage. We can’t afford a dryer, an air purifier, or the extra electricity anymore. And still every single day, we have to walk through smoke just to get around our own neighbourhood. I’ve been in so much pain because of this. Sometimes I can’t help but think if only I could have given my child fully developed lungs during my pregnancy, maybe she wouldn’t be suffering like this now.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve reported this many times, but nothing has changed. NEA always gives us a very standard reply and says the issue has been “resolved” but I can tell you the situation has only gotten worse in the past few months, maybe it’s because many vapers quit vaping and went back to cigarettes. Last month, I once requested an uncle who was riding the lift with my child and me, to not smoke in the lift. Then he verbally abused me, nearly hit me, and even blew smoke directly at my child, leaving me carrying fear all the way home. </p>\n\n<p>Secondhand and thirdhand smoke are far more serious than people realize. For a financially strained family like ours, life is already hard enough. Without proper enforcement and legal protection, we can’t even have something as basic as clean air, one of the most fundamental things everyone should be able to rely on.</p>\n\n<p>If smokers stayed in the designated smoking areas, no one would be affected and there would be no problem. But now they’ve become increasingly reckless and inconsiderate. My family and I are living in constant discomfort, and I don’t think I’m the only one struggling with this secondhand smoke issue. We’re just an ordinary financially strained household as we can’t even afford a dryer to protect our clothes from the smoke. I’m not asking for the world to feel sorry for us, but it’s hard to watch my child suffer from asthma and breathing problems because of something we have no control over. </p>\n\n<p>I understand that the government strictly regulate vaping, but I hope they also realize that after banning vapes, smokers start lighting up freely in non-smoking areas, and that this situation needs stronger enforcement. What can I do to make the government take this seriously and enforce stronger laws to stop this secondhand smoke problem?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Recently completed a freelance coding instructor role under MOE going around primary school to teach coding and AI. </p>\n\n<p>4) Not much savings due to the fact that I have closed myself off so much in my 20s due to my failure and mentally ill mother influence. Covid lockdown didn’t help either.</p>\n\n<p>Current state:</p>\n\n<p>1) New role with only 3k but it’s very tiring due to the demands of being a backend support. </p>\n\n<p>2) Got an offer to continue the freelance coding trainer with a 50% bump in rate but unsure if I can commit to it due to me having a full time now. </p>\n\n<p>3) Mental state is still in a burnout state and feeling like a constant blur on a daily basis. Even my colleagues noticed this and are concerned about me. </p>\n\n<p>TDLR; I am way behind in life. I am burning out while looking at how screwed my career is now. I can only blame myself for not being strong enough and let my environment influence me and now I am suffering for it. My resume is screwed too so at this point in time, I wasn’t sure how I can keep this up all the time. I envy how others are able to do it while I don’t have the capacity to even be able to fake a smile and keep my heads up. </p>\n\n<p>I don’t have a lot of people to talk to either since most of my friends have their own family and talking to my own family would only make me feel worst because I don’t feel heard at all. </p>\n\n<p>I used to be ambitious and I want to give my family a better life by changing things. Nobody listens to the advices I shared despite my warnings on how I see certain things coming. In the end we all suffered because nobody listens and I don’t know when I got into this mental spiralling even though I suspected I have anxiety issues since young.  </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

However, I might need to consider doing shift work (early morning/afternoon to midnight shift, rotating once a month).</p>\n\n<p>I am however pretty dissatisfied with my current lifestyle; I do have a few close friends that I meet 2-3 times a week at night to complain about life and rokok, but I would like to have more purpose and things to look forward to in life. No girlfriend unfortunately so that is off the table :&lt; </p>\n\n<p>Would appreciate any advice from seniors with experience navigating this quarter life crisis!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Like how do people survive daily?</p>\n\n<p>It has been a while since work becomes even busier and I am preparing for my wedding next year. But sadly I really have no time to prepare or think about my wedding. Same goes with my fiance.\nThinking about the future, I thought I would be excited on the thought of getting married, having my own family, my own house. But I am only getting scared. Moreover, my parents and my in law will only get older... there will be time when I will need to care for them too.</p>\n\n<p>Me and my fiance, we want to have at least 1 kid... people said when it happens, it will just work out magically. But I cannot help but being worried. If I am pregnant and I need to work like now, honestly I am not sure if I can do it. And when the baby is born, even if there is daycare, what if I don&#39;t have time to pick him up? Or even taking care of him when I bring him home?</p>\n\n<p>We plan to bring my in law to live with us. She is an adult but of course me and my husband to be need to care for her. Like taking her out, bringing her for health check, etc. I am afraid we will not have the brain for that if our work is like this.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder if I can cope with everything happening at once: work, housework, kids, parents?</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure if it is just me... Maybe I am too negative about everything when I should be thankful to have a job in this economy? But how about my mental and physical health? Everyday I just feel very drained.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
