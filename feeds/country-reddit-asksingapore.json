This happened many times every day and both in work related discussions and during the meals. Like there were me and 3 Singaporean colleagues sharing a table and out of sudden they all just switched to Chinese. At some point they always switched back to English but never explained why or what they needed to chat in Chinese. </p>\n\n<p>I find it quite rude and awkward at the same time.

It feels like I am lacking behind in life so much already as compared to others. All my younger colleagues were asking me why I took up this role because I seem educated and deserved so much better. This got me to question myself if I am doing this right. </p>\n\n<p>Backstory: </p>\n\n<p>1) Took longer time to graduate due to bad mental health. Mental state has cause me to suffered a lot. Not even a local uni grad. </p>\n\n<p>2) Did sales role but didn’t last. Jobs like ops and contract job didn’t last long either. I am too scattered.</p>\n\n<p>3) Did a swimming instructor part time job in the weekend for extra income and setting it as a backup for the long run. Recently completed a freelance coding instructor role under MOE going around primary school to teach coding and AI. </p>\n\n<p>4) Not much savings due to the fact that I have closed myself off so much in my 20s due to my failure and mentally ill mother influence. Covid lockdown didn’t help either.</p>\n\n<p>Current state:</p>\n\n<p>1) New role with only 3k but it’s very tiring due to the demands of being a backend support. </p>\n\n<p>2) Got an offer to continue the freelance coding trainer with a 50% bump in rate but unsure if I can commit to it due to me having a full time now. </p>\n\n<p>3) Mental state is still in a burnout state and feeling like a constant blur on a daily basis. Even my colleagues noticed this and are concerned about me. </p>\n\n<p>TDLR; I am way behind in life. I am burning out while looking at how screwed my career is now. I can only blame myself for not being strong enough and let my environment influence me and now I am suffering for it. My resume is screwed too so at this point in time, I wasn’t sure how I can keep this up all the time. I envy how others are able to do it while I don’t have the capacity to even be able to fake a smile and keep my heads up. </p>\n\n<p>I don’t have a lot of people to talk to either since most of my friends have their own family and talking to my own family would only make me feel worst because I don’t feel heard at all. </p>\n\n<p>I used to be ambitious and I want to give my family a better life by changing things. Nobody listens to the advices I shared despite my warnings on how I see certain things coming. In the end we all suffered because nobody listens and I don’t know when I got into this mental spiralling even though I suspected I have anxiety issues since young.  </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Like how do people survive daily?</p>\n\n<p>It has been a while since work becomes even busier and I am preparing for my wedding next year. But sadly I really have no time to prepare or think about my wedding. Same goes with my fiance.\nThinking about the future, I thought I would be excited on the thought of getting married, having my own family, my own house. But I am only getting scared. Moreover, my parents and my in law will only get older... there will be time when I will need to care for them too.</p>\n\n<p>Me and my fiance, we want to have at least 1 kid... people said when it happens, it will just work out magically. But I cannot help but being worried. If I am pregnant and I need to work like now, honestly I am not sure if I can do it. And when the baby is born, even if there is daycare, what if I don&#39;t have time to pick him up? Or even taking care of him when I bring him home?</p>\n\n<p>We plan to bring my in law to live with us. She is an adult but of course me and my husband to be need to care for her. Like taking her out, bringing her for health check, etc. I am afraid we will not have the brain for that if our work is like this.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder if I can cope with everything happening at once: work, housework, kids, parents?</p>\n\n<p>I am not sure if it is just me... Maybe I am too negative about everything when I should be thankful to have a job in this economy? But how about my mental and physical health?
