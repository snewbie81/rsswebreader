Recently I had the opportunity to meet my Singaporean colleagues face-to-face for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>They were all nice and very welcoming towards me, but what I found weird was that quite often they switched to Chinese very randomly in the middle of a conversation. This happened many times every day and both in work related discussions and during the meals. Like there were me and 3 Singaporean colleagues sharing a table and out of sudden they all just switched to Chinese. At some point they always switched back to English but never explained why or what they needed to chat in Chinese. </p>\n\n<p>I find it quite rude and awkward at the same time. Is this something usual in Singapore or should I take it personally?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
